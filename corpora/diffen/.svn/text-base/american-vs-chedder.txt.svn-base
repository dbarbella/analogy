American Cheese vs. Cheddar Cheese

Cheddar is a hard English cheese while American cheese is a smooth and creamy processed cheese. Cheddar has more flavor while American cheese, being artificially processed rather than aged naturally, is less expensive. Because it is processed, American "cheese" doesn't technically qualify as cheese and cannot be sold without labeling it as “processed cheese”. That’s the reason “Kraft Singles” can’t be legally sold as “Kraft Cheese” and is always labeled as “processed cheese”.

History
American cheese was first made by the British colonists in America, and was then exported back to England by 1970s.

Cheddar cheese is a hard, sharp-tasting cheese. Its natural color ranges from pale yellow to off-white, although some manufacturers color the cheese with a brighter yellow. It is slightly crumbly.

Production
American cheese is made with milk, whey, milk and whey proteins, food coloring, flavorings, emulsifiers and salt. The ingredients are blended and heated with emulsifiers (like potassium phosphate, sodium or citrate) and poured into moulds to solidify. A stabilizing agent like polysaccharide xanthan gum is sometimes added to prevent separation of the ingredients.

Cheddar cheese is made with cow’s milk. After heating, the curd is kneaded with salt, cut into cubes to drain the whey, then stacked and turned. It is then matured at a constant temperature, e.g. in caves, for 3 to 18 months.

Uses
American cheese is most commonly used in America on hamburgers, grilled cheese sandwiches, macaroni and cheese and cheese dips.

Cheddar cheese is the most popular cheese in the UK and the second most popular cheese in the US. It is used in a huge variety of recipes.

Substitutes
