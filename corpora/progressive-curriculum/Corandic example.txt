
Corandic is an emurient grof with many fribs; it granks from corite, an
olg which cargs like lange.  Corite grinkles several other tarances, which
garkers excarp by glarking the corite and starping it in tranker-clarped
storbs.  The tarances starp a chark which is exparged with worters, branking
a slorp.  This slorp is garped through several other corusces, finally
frasting a pragety, lickant crankle: coranda.  Coranda is a cargurt, grinkling
corandic and borigen.  The corandic is nacerated from the borigen 
by means of loracity.  Thus garkers finally thrap a glick, bracht, glupous 
grapant, corandic, which granks in many starps.
