A pipe connects cylinder c1 to cylinder c2. Cylinder c1 contains 5 liters of water. Cylinder c2 contains 2 liters of water. Water flows from cylinder c1 to cylinder c2, because the level in cylinder c1 is greater than the level in cylinder c2. The higher the pressure in cylinder c1, the higher the flowrate of the water. As the amount of water in cylinder c2 increases, the pressure in cylinder c2 increases.
