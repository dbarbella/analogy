compile_folder.py can be used to take all of the .txt files in a folder and compile them into one properly-formatted .csv. Usage instructions for that script are found in the script itself. You can test it by unzipping blogs.zip into its own folder and running on that.

Because blogs.zip is too large to store in github, you will need to retrive blogs.zip from ~dbarbella/analogy/corpora

You can also get blogs.txt, the compiled version, directly from there as well.
