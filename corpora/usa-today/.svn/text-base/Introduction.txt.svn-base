A hurricane barreling up the coast. Thunderstorms spawning tornadoes on the Great 
Plains. Ice storms glazing roads across the Midwest. Most people see these as frightening, 
freak acts of nature that exist to inflict death and destruction.
In reality, it's just the opposite. Storms perform a much needed function. They make 
our Earth livable.
We need to remember there are tremendous differences between heat and cold on the 
Earth. Because of the way the sun shines on the globe, the tropics are always hot and the 
polar latitudes are cold. They make the planet tolerable to live on, the warm and cold air 
must be mixed.
That's what storms are all about.
When a winter storm forms, it's like a giant eggbeater sweeping across the planet 
mixing cold polar air with warm tropical air.
This process works very well most of the year. But during the summer, the cold air 
retreats northward toward the North Pole, leaving a huge buildup of heat in the tropics. 
This heat must be dissipated and nature has a very effective way of doing this. It's called 
a hurricane.
When a hurricane forms, it means the tropical atmosphere is boiling. Heat is 
removed from the tropics when the spinning bubble of hot air moves toward the poles.
If human beings would learn to live in harmony with the forces of nature, we could 
minimize our problems. Building a house on an earthquake fault line in California is not 
very wise. Likewise, we should limit development along river valleys subject to flooding 
or on small, sandy coastal islands exposed to devastating hurricanes. But we have 
decided not to do that in this country, so we are extremely vulnerable to storms.
To live in harmony with nature, we must understand atmospheric forces. We need to 
understand storms   and all our weather systems. Then we can adjust to them and keep 
out of harm's way.
This book gives a clear explanation of those forces.
From fronts and storms to rainbows and sunsets; from what happens on the molecular 
level in clouds to big questions about the climate's future. Jack Williams, USA TODAY's 
longtime weather editor, has amassed the basic knowledge of the great atmospheric 
machines. Difficult concepts have been illustrated with the kind of exciting, colorful 
graphics that have become the trademark of USA TODAY.
Scientific discoveries and weather forecasts are the result of a lot of hard work by a 
lot of people. Along with explaining how the weather works, this book introduces you to 
a few of the people responsible for our knowledge of the atmosphere.
So, fasten your seat belts and prepare to blast-off on an exciting trip into the world of 
atmospheric phenomena. I trust you will enjoy the trip!
