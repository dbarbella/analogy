By early morning April 2, 1974, meteorologists at the National Severe Storms 
Forecast Center in Kansas City; Mo., knew big trouble was brewing for April 3.
Cold air was spreading snow in the Rockies, while to the southeast air over the 75 F 
waters of the Gulf of Mexico was growing more humid. Computer forecasts showed a 
low-pressure center would form just east of the Rockies and strengthen as it moved 
eastward.
The computer forecasts also showed that on April 3, jet stream winds would be 
blowing faster than 100 mph from Texas to New England. And forecasts showed winds 
around the growing low-pressure area would be doing two things: pushing dry air 
eastward across the Mississippi River and pulling warm, extremely humid air northward 
from the Gulf to the Ohio Valley.
It was a perfect setup for treacherous thunderstorms, the land that spin out the 
strongest tornadoes.
Thunderstorms are dangerous in several ways. Tornadoes are their most feared 
product. Some thunderstorms blast the Earth with damaging straight-line winds or spew 
chunks of ice - hail - that can beat a field of corn into the ground. Thunderstorms are 
responsible for many flash floods, weather's biggest taller in the United States. And all 
thunderstorms generate lightning, the USA's second biggest weather killer.
The thunderstorms of April 3 and 4, 1974, hit the Plains with what became known as 
the Super Out-break, 127 tornadoes - the largest, most damaging tornado outbreak in 
history. Winds in at least six of the tornadoes were faster than 261 miles per hour, making 
them Category 5 storms on the 1 to 5 Fujita Tornado Scale. That's about a normal 
decade's worth of Category 5 storms. Some of the April 3, 1974, tornadoes are among the 
strongest ever recorded.
Three hundred fifteen people in 11 states were killed; 6,142 were injured. Without 
warnings, many more would have died. Total damage was more than $600 million. The 
Red Cross estimated that 27,590 families suffered some kind of loss.
The tornadoes began in Indiana around 9:30 on the morning of April 3, reached a 
peak that afternoon and evening along lines from Alabama into Ohio. The Super 
Outbreak finally ended with predawn twisters April 4 in West Virginia and Virginia.
The hardest hit town was Xenia, Ohio, 16 miles east of Dayton, where a half-mile 
wide tornado smashed homes, businesses and buildings in the town and at the nearby 
campuses of Central State and Wilberforce universities.

In Xenia the tornado lifted freight cars of a passing train and threw them across 
streets. It demolished Central High School an hour after most students had left for the 
day. A teacher and students rehearsing for a play fled the auditorium seconds before the 
twister tossed two school buses through the wall and onto the stage.

Tornadoes, severe storms are local
While tornadoes like those of the Super Outbreak are extremely fierce, they are also 
small-scale events compared to extratropical cyclones and hurricanes.
The area directly threatened by the Super Outbreak tornadoes covered around 
490,000 square miles. Yet tornadoes and other violent winds damaged only about 600 
square miles inside that area. But, as Frederick Ostby, director of the National Severe 
Storms Forecast Center points out, everyone in the 490,000-square-mile area had an 
equal chance of being hit.
While conditions were right for fierce thunderstorms across the entire area, small-
scale atmospheric events have to come together in exactly the right way to create a 
tornado. Even with the best technology and highest skills, forecasters have no way of 
knowing more than about 20 minutes ahead of time exactly where a tornado will form 
and where it will go.
This doesn't mean we're completely at the mercy of tornadoes.
First, only a little more than one percent of the tornadoes that hit the United States 
have winds stronger than 200 mph, putting them in Categories 4 and 5 on the Fujita scale. 
Yet, these twisters account for more than 70 percent of all tornado deaths. These large, 
most dangerous tornadoes are the ones that new forecasting technology can detect 20 
minutes ahead of time.
Second, people who know what to do have a good chance of staying safe, if they stay 
alert to warnings and then act quickly and correctly.

Basic building blocks of thunderstorms
To see how thunderstorms create tornadoes and other hazards, it's important to know 
how they work
In Chapter 5, we saw how water takes up energy when it evaporates and then 
releases this energy - called latent heat - when it condenses into liquid. We also saw how 
this heat slows the cooling of rising air making it more likely to continue rising. In such a 
case, we end up with warm air rising in some places and cool air descending in others. 
This process is called convection. Thunderstorms are convective storms.
Thunderstorms need unstable air, a temperature profile with air near the ground and 
cold air aloft. This explains why thunderstorms are more likely in the spring and summer 
than in the fall and winter. In spring and summer the sun warms the ground, which warms 
the air near the ground. Air near the ground also is warmed in the fall, but there's an 
important difference.
	
	In the spring the air aloft retains its winter cold; the air will be more unstable than 
in the fall when the air aloft retains its summer warmth.

The growth of thunderstorm knowledge
In his 1841 book, The Philosophy of Storms, J. P Espy, a leading 19th century 
American scientist, presented the basic idea of how thunderstorms are powered by latent 
heat released as water vapor condenses.
The first attempts at scientific forecasting of tornadoes were begun in the 1880s by 
John P Finley of the U.S. Army Signal Service - later the Signal Corps -which handled 
the nation's weather forecasting at the time. In 1884 and 1885, based on his weather 
observations, Finley produced generalized forecasts that stated tornadoes would be 
possible on certain days. Finley realized that in the central United States days much like 
those that brought the Super Outbreak were the most dangerous. In 1886, the Army 
discontinued the experiment because, it said, the harm done by a (tornado) prediction 
would eventually be greater than that which results from the tornado itself. The 
authorities envisioned deaths from panic if people heard tornadoes were possible on a 
certain day. Tornado forecasts for the public didn't begin again until 1952.
As Finley's forecasts showed, scientists understood what general conditions favor 
thunderstorms. But a detailed picture of thunderstorms didn't begin emerging until after 
World War II.
In 1946 and 1947, Horace R. Byers and R. R. Braham led the federally funded 
Thunderstorm Project that studied storms in Florida and Ohio. Their 1949 book, The 
Thunderstorm, outlined the basic picture of convective storms that researchers have been 
building on since. The drawings on Page 114 show the basic model of thunderstorms that 
Byers and Braham worked out.
By the 1950s, researchers understood that thunderstorms need a supply of warm, 
humid, unstable air and something to give that air an initial upward shove. Scientists 
understood that shove could come from heating of air near the ground, lifting of warm air 
by under-cutting cold air - such as along a cold front - or wind pushing air up hills or 
mountains. But it was also known that thunderstorms sometimes occurred when none of 
the three known conditions supplying the upward shove was present.
Until recent years scientists puzzled over scattered thunderstorms that seemed to pop 
up at random. You still sometimes hear forecasters refer to pop up thunderstorms. 
Today's observational technology, however, has taken most of the mystery out of such 
storms, says David Jorgensen, head of the Mesoscale Research Division at the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Laboratory in Boulder; Col.
Better observation and Doppler radar show that old style forecasting techniques 
simply missed some faint air boundaries that can get thunderstorms started.
These new techniques, says Jorgensen, explain thunderstorms that seem to pop up 
out of nowhere. It's rare to have thunderstorms develop where there isn't a boundary. 
Such boundaries can be where air flowing from one thunderstorm meets air from another, 
maybe more than 100 miles away from either original storm, Jorgensen says. If you get 
an upper-level disturbance over them, it will fire off convective storms, and could make a 
squall line.
In Texas, and sometimes farther to the north on the Plains, thunderstorms often are 
triggered on the dry line. This is the boundary between warm, but dry air moving east, 
and downhill, from the Southwest deserts, and warm, humid Gulf of Mexico air moving 
northwest.
The humid-dry air boundary triggers thunderstorms, often severe storms. 
Researchers are still trying to discover exactly how the dry line causes severe thun-
derstorms.
Our understanding of thunderstorms began growing during the 1950s and 1960s as 
radar became a regular tool for National Weather Service forecasters. Researchers also 
looked into how the dynamics of the upper air could affect small-scale events such as 
thunderstorms.
Another key to understanding thunderstorms was the establishment in 1964 of the 
National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla. The lab became a center for 
Doppler radar observations of thunderstorms. In 1972, the lab and the nearby University 
of Oklahoma began sending teams of meteorologists and students out to intercept storms. 
These storm chasers gathered an impressive collection of instrument observations as well 
as still photos and films in and around severe thunderstorms.
On-the-scene photos and data collected by the chasers were viral for the scientists 
trying to understand the complex patterns they were seeing on their Doppler radars. Over 
the years scientists put other sophisticated instruments to work observing thunderstorms 
from both the ground and airplanes. The resulting flood of data, combined with computer 
modeling, has led to today's picture of thunderstorms and tornadoes.

More complicated kinds of storms
The single cell thunderstorm shown in the drawing on Page 114 is relatively 
uncommon, but it is the basic building block of more complex storms.
Multicell storms, which are clusters of single cell storms, are the most common land 
of thunderstorms. Air flowing outward from one storm can supply the upward push of 
warm, humid air needed to trigger other cells.
Often we hear of air mass thunderstorms. These are storms that grow during the 
afternoon on warm, humid days when no fronts or large-scale storm systems are around. 
Such storms can be single-cell or multicell.
While single-cell or scattered multicell storms aren't the parents of strong tornadoes, 
they have other dangers. Lightning is always a thunderstorm hazard; small storms that 
produce only one or two lightning bolts have killed people. As we'll see later, small 
thunderstorms also can produce deadly winds called downbursts.

Conditions needed for killer storms
Fierce thunderstorms, ones that cause the strongest winds and largest hail, require 
special conditions. This is why such storms are relatively rare and also why they occur 
more often in the United States than anywhere else.

These conditions include:
? Unstable air that will continue rising when it's forced upward.
? A disturbance in the upper-air flow, such as a short wave as described in Chapter 4.
? A layer of stable air, especially an inversion, atop warm humid air near the ground. 
This holds back convection as the air near the ground becomes hotter during the day. 
Otherwise, fair weather clouds or even small thunderstorms could grow early in the day, 
using the available energy. An inversion is like a lid held on a boiling pot. Eventually, 
when enough steam builds up, the lid blows off. When the hot, humid air below an inver-
sion finally breaks through, large thunderstorms explode.
? A fresh supply of warm, humid air flowing in near the ground. High-altitude cold 
air flowing in also helps.
?	Wind speeds that increase with altitude. Fast-moving, high-altitude winds 
interacting with the updraft promote rotation in the storm, which helps keep the storm 
going. These winds also make thunderstorms tilt, rather than go straight up. This adds to 
their strength. A tilted thunderstorm means precipitation from high in the storm doesn't 
fall back into the updraft, choking it. Instead, precipitation falls into dry air, which adds 
to a storm's energy.
Precipitation falling into cool, dry air is a feature of the strongest kinds of 
thunderstorms, squall line storms and supercells.

As we saw in Chapter 5, when water evaporates it cook the surroundings. 
Precipitation evaporating in dry air cools the air, making it heavier. This creates what 
University of Chicago researcher Theodore Fujita calls a cold air balloon that plunges 
downward. Heat released by condensing water vapor in rising air powers all thun-
derstorms. The heat taken up by evaporating liquid water adds to the power of squall line 
and supercell thunderstorms, by sending cooled air hurtling downward.

Squall-line thunderstorms
In simple terms, squall lines are lines of thunderstorms. But they're more than that. 
They are an example of what meteorologists call a mesoscale convective system.
Mesoscale refers to weather systems up to about 250 miles across. Convective means 
thunderstorms are involved, and system means the whole thing is organized. Squall lines 
are found in both the tropics and in the middle latitudes. We'll look at the middle latitude 
squall lines such as those common across the USA east of the Rockies.
Mid-latitude squall lines produce strong, straight-line winds, hail and sometimes 
tornadoes. They can be especially disruptive to aviation because the individual 
thunderstorms in a squall line can top out above 50,000 feet, higher than the 30,000 to 
40,000-feet cruising altitude of jet airliners. Since pilots don't want to fly through such 
storms, a squall line can force airplanes to take detours of 200 miles or more.
Squall lines can form along cold fronts, but the strongest and most common lines 
form as much as 100 or more miles ahead of an advancing cold front in the warm sector 
of an extratropical cyclone. Such lines are known as prefrontal squall lines.
We really don't know why prefrontal squall lines are the most prevalent, says 
Jorgensen. This is an area of active research. Possibly they are triggered by solitary 
waves as shown on Page 97. Upper-air disturbances could also play a role.
In addition to the thunderstorms, squall lines often trail a large area of flat, stratus 
clouds that produce steady rain for hours after the thunderstorms and their heavier rain 
have moved on.
Since the early 1980s, researchers have been interested in the organized systems of 
clouds and rain that sometimes develop in the stratiform clouds formed by squall lines. 
These clusters of clouds take on a circulation of their own, which outlasts the parent 
squall line. These clusters, known as mesoscale convective complexes - a kind of 
mesoscale convective system - supply about 80 percent of the growing-season rain on the 
Plains and across the Midwestern Corn Belt.

Supercells: The kings of thunderstorms
When conditions are right, a large thunderstorm will form either by itself or on the 
southwestern end of a squall line. Unlike a normal multicell thunderstorm that might last 
40 minutes, this storm will last several hours. It can travel 200 miles or mote, often 
spinning out a series of strong tornadoes. This is a supercell. It is an appropriate name.
As shown in the drawings on Page 120-121, the supercell involves an extraordinarily 
complicated interplay of atmospheric forces. The key to the storm's long life and power is 
the flow of middle atmospheric winds around the central updraft and then downward to 
create the storm's rear-flank downdraft. The storm's organization ensures that the flow of 
warm, humid air into the storm - a power source - continues for hours. Evaporation of 
precipitation into dry air also adds to the storm's power as it does in squall-line 
thunderstorms.

A close look at tornadoes
While tornadoes come in several varieties, here we'll classify them into two general 
kinds:
The first land of tornado forms in the outflow of air from a thunderstorm. These 
storms are usually weak. They have a shallow, localized vortex, usually last less than five 
minutes and their winds rarely exceed 150 miles an hour; F-2 on the Fujita Scale. You 
might think of them like the swirls of water you sometimes see in a fast-moving stream as 
it flows past obstacles.
The second kind of tornado is the strongest. These storms are found where air is 
flowing into a thunderstorm, in the updraft area. (See the supercell drawing on Pages 
120-121.) Doppler radar measurements show that such tornadoes begin at the storm's 
middle levels and then grow both up into the storm and down toward the ground.

How tornadoes get their twist
While scientists are still working out the details of exactly how tornadoes acquire 
their spinning motion, they have rejected old ideas that it is created by the Coriolis Effect 
acting on inflowing winds. In theory a tornado could get spin in this way, but it would 
take more time than some tornadoes seem to have.
Also, if the Coriolis Effect were the only source of tornado rotation, all Northern 
Hemisphere tornadoes would spin counterclockwise. While most Northern Hemisphere 
tornadoes spin in that direction, clockwise spinning twisters have been photographed.

Downbursts: A new discovery
In addition to being the most destructive day of tornadoes on record, the Super 
Outbreak of April 3 and 4, 1974, led to the discovery of a source of thunderstorm danger 
that had not been recognized. Theodore Fujita was flying near Beckley, W. Va., 
surveying storm damage, when he noticed what he calls a starburst pattern of tree 
damage, not the circular or semi-circular swaths left by tornadoes. It reminded him of 
something he had seen in Japan.
As he looked down at the damage, he later wrote, it was natural to visualize a jet of 
downdraft, which hard-landed at the center of the starburst. As Fujita continued studying 
damage from the outbreak, he found a number of other; similar damage patterns. The 
following year, while investigating the June 24,1975, crash of an Eastern Airlines Boeing 
727 at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, Fujita hypothesized that the airliner had 
flown through the same kind of winds that had caused the starburst pattern he had seen in 
West Virginia.
Fellow scientists at first rejected Fujita's hypothesis, but as we'll see in Chapter 11, 
various studies confirmed the theory and led to a decision to spend millions on special 
airport radars to spot such downbursts in time to warn pilots. The drawing at right shows 
what causes thunderstorms to produce such winds.

Derechos: Severe windstorms
Most people around Wichita, Kansas, didn't realize what hit them June 19,1990.
The 116 mph winds were as strong as an F-2 tornado but unlike a tornado's roughly 
quarter-mile-wide damage path, the winds did more than $50 million of damage all 
around Wichita and Sedgwick County Trees were toppled, small buildings ripped apart, 
more than 1,000 power poles came down.
The severe windstorms were what is known as derechos, a name coined in the 1880s by 
Gustavus Hinrichs, director of the Iowa Weather Service. According to Robert H. Johns 
of the Severe Storms Forecast Center; the name, (pronounced day-RAY-cho), comes from 
a Spanish word meaning  straight ahead or direct. He says Hinrichs intended it to contrast 
with tornado, which comes from a Spanish word for turn.

Derechos are the result of squall-line thunderstorms that create one downburst after 
another as they move along. Occasionally they'll also spin out a small tornado or two. 
They occur most frequently from the central and northern Plains across the Midwest into 
the Ohio Valley in the late spring and summer.
Johns, who works on improving forecasts of derechos, says the windstorms are 
relatively common. He counted 70 during one four-year period in the 1980s. To qualify 
as a derecho, a storm must have winds stronger than 58 mph and spread damage across 
an area at least 280 miles long.
Very humid weather with strong winds in the middle atmosphere causes the storms. 
Dry air enters the storms a couple of miles above ground and is cooled when precipitation 
falls into it and evaporates. The cooled, and therefore heavier; air blasts down carrying 
the momentum of the fast upper-air winds with it, creating the strong gusts at the ground.

Hail, yet another thunderstorm danger
In most parts of the United States hailstones much bigger than peas are rare, which is 
something to be thankful for since hail can wipe out a field of corn, wheat or vegetables 
in minutes. The Great Plains from Texas north into Canada are an exception; large 
hailstones are relatively common.
Hailstones are balls of ice that grow as they're held up by thunderstorm updrafts 
while supercooled water drops hit and freeze onto them. The faster the updraft, the bigger 
the stones can grow. Details of how hailstones grow are complicated, but the results, 
especially on the Plains, are irregular balls of ice that can be as large as baseballs, 
sometimes even bigger. While crops are the major victims, hail is also a hazard to 
vehicles and windows of homes and businesses.

Normally hall falls for a shorter time than rain from the same storm, since a smaller 
area of the storm has the right conditions to manufacture hail. While hail falls on any 
particular place for only a few minutes, in rare cases it has been known to fall for an hour 
or so, leaving several inches of icy balls on the ground. Since thunderstorms normally 
move, hail usually falls in swaths that can be 100 miles long (although five or 10 mile 
swaths are more common) and 10 or more miles wide.
Large hailstones can fall at a rate of 90 mph and in rare cases weigh more than a 
pound. Such a missile falling from the sky could be deadly, but the last known hail death 
in the United States was an infant killed in Fort Collins, Col., in August 1979.

Lightning makes them thunderstorms
Thunderstorms are called thunderstorms for the obvious reason that they produce 
thunder. And thunder, in turn, is a product of lightning.
Benjamin Franklin showed with his famous late experiment in 1752 that lightning is 
electricity. Since then scientists have learned much about lightning, but many questions 
remain. Efforts are still being made to discover what goes on at the molecular level and 
what happens in a miles-long flash.
Here's the key question: How do clouds build up the electrical charges that lead to 
lightning flashes? Scientists have developed two kinds of models to explain the electrical 
structure of clouds.
Precipitation theories hold that negative and positive charges are left on different size 
raindrops, graupel and hail as they collide in a cloud. Heavier particles carry a negative 
charge to the bottom of the cloud.
Convection models propose that updrafts carry positive charges normally found near 
the ground upward while downdrafts carry negative charges from the upper air 
downward.
Both models explain some observations, but neither explains everything that's known 
about lightning. Many researchers believe that some combination of the two theories will 
turn out to hold the answer. They also believe that understanding the causes of lightning 
will clear up other questions about thunderstorms. More knowledge of how electrical 
charges develop is likely to shed light on how ice and water drops grow in clouds.

Forecasting thunderstorms and tornadoes
Severe thunderstorm and tornado forecasting begins with the wide-ranging computer 
forecasts produced by the National Weather Service's National Meteorological Center in 
Camp Springs, Md. Meanwhile, each night, while most of the country is sleeping, 
forecasters at the Severe Storms Forecast Center in downtown Kansas City comb 
nationwide computer forecasts and other data to get a handle on where dangerous 
thunderstorms would be likely the next couple of days.
At 1 a.m. each day a forecaster sends out a severe weather outlook bulletin, saying 
either that the next couple days will be quiet or giving the national picture of conditions 
that could spawn severe storms. This outlook gives the day shifts at the Kansas City 
Center and forecasters elsewhere a running start on what to look for.
If conditions favor severe storms, the Center's forecasters use what's known as 
interactive computer technology to stay on top of things. An interactive system enables a 
forecaster to combine various kinds of data on one computer screen, for example a 
satellite photo, maps showing weather observations at different levels of the atmosphere 
and the latest map showing every lightning bolt that has hit the ground in the last half 
hour The forecaster also can have the computer calculate various kinds of useful 
information, for example the stability of the air at various locations.
This interactive system enables the forecaster to process and look at great volumes of 
data in a short period of time in rapidly developing situations, says the Center's Director 
Frederick Ostby. It gives us a better handle on how the moisture is moving, where the 
areas of convergence are taking place.
When a Center forecaster decides that conditions will be ripe for either tornadoes or 
severe thunderstorms over a wide area, the forecaster issues a watch. The computer helps 
here, too. Years ago the forecaster would have to look on a map for the names of towns 
that would define the area covered by the watch and then compose the watch message. 
Now; the forecaster outlines the threatened area on the computer screen and the computer 
puts in the names of the affected towns.
A watch issued by the center means only that conditions are favorable for dangerous 
weather. The message goes out to National Weather Service offices in the threatened 
area. The local offices broadcast the information on NOAA weather radio and it's made 
available to news media.
In many areas, especially on the Plains, a tornado watch triggers alerts to local 
storm-spotter networks. These can be police officers or volunteers who have taken 
training courses in how to recognize tornadoes and other dangerous weather.
They have quick communication, usually radio, tied directly to the local Weather 
Service office. Since conventional weather radar can't tell for sure if a thunderstorm is 
producing a tornado, volunteer weather watchers or spotters are vital to quick warnings.
In Chapter 11 we'll look at how new technology and improvements in forecasting 
techniques should allow both watches and warnings to be issued further ahead of time 
and also better define the threatened area. Today's watches and warnings often cover 
much wider areas than storms will hit.

Living with dangerous thunderstorms
No matter how good the watches and warnings for severe thunderstorms and 
tornadoes, life-and-death decisions are up to individuals. Lessons learned during the 
April 3-4, 1974, Super Outbreak still apply.
Any time killer weather strikes the United States the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Weather Service, appoints a 
team to investigate the disaster. This survey team goes out quickly to try to discover what 
the Weather Service and others could do to save lives in the future. The team examines 
the forecasts, the warnings and the response. It then makes recommendations for 
improvement.
The team that investigated the April 3-4, 1974, tornado outbreak said in its report: 
Everywhere the survey teams went - and especially in Guin, Ala., Brandenburg, Ky., 
Monticello, Ind., and Xenia, Ohio - the question was the same. How could anyone have 
survived?' Education somewhere, at some time, through some means, had to be the 
answer. The people in those towns and elsewhere in 11 states heard weather watches and 
warnings over radio and television; were notified by their neighbors, relatives or friends; 
saw the tornadoes approaching; or heard the ominous roar of the tornado. In interviews 
with people in all the hard-hit areas, the team found very few who were unaware that they 
were under a severe weather threat.
But most important, they knew what to do when the time came to take action. They all 
seemed to know that a basement, if they had one, was the best place to be. Others went 
into closets, under beds, in ravines, behind a sofa, under stairwells, in the center of the 
home, under dining room tables, and in the halls of large well-constructed brick 
buildings. They got out of gymnasiums and large open rooms, stayed away from 
windows, protected their heads from flying debris. 

The team wrote about a Hanover; Ind., high school physics teacher who had talked about 
tornado safety in his class the day before. Among other things, he told his students of the 
danger of being hit by a tornado in a vehicle. He told them to leave their cars and take 
shelter in a ditch. The next day one of his students was on a school bus on a collision 
course with a tornado. He persuaded the driver to stop and everyone headed for a ditch. 
The tornado demolished the bus, but not a single student or the driver was hurt.
Warnings and education weren't the whole story; however. The team also cited the 
role of luck. For instance, one tornado destroyed downtown Monticello, Ind., killing two 
people. But, lives were saved because businesses were closed, as they normally were on 
Wednesday afternoons.
In many ways, however; those in the path of a tornado or other severe thunderstorm, 
do much to create their own luck. While it's almost never possible to do much about 
saving property in the path of a storm, the kinds of quick action that saved lives April 3-
4, 1974, continues to allow people to survive the world's strongest winds.
