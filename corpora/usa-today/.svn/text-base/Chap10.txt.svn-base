Don't look out the window. If you're outside, don't look up. Now, describe the sky.
Is it clear or cloudy? If there are clouds, do they cover all of the sky or only part? 
Are the clouds mostly puffy or flat, or a combination of the two?
If you failed this test, don't feel alone. Few people today pay much attention to the 
sky, which helps explain why many of its common objects, such as the planet Venus or 
lens-shaped clouds, sometimes are reported as unidentified flying objects.
A few decades ago people looked to the sky often to pick up clues about what would 
happen with the weather. Today we're more likely to look at a television screen for 
weather information. But if you get your forecasts only from radio or television, you're 
getting only part of the picture.
Combining weather information from television, radio or newspaper reports with 
what you see in the sky is the best way to understand the weather. Once you start looking 
at the sky regularly, you'll see a host of phenomena, not only clouds, but also various 
optical effects caused by the interplay of light with the atmosphere and clouds.
In this chapter we will first look at some of the sky's optical phenomena, beginning 
with why the sky is blue. Then we'll look at some of the many cloud forms and what they 
tell us about the weather. Finally, we'll introduce you to the atmosphere's layers.

Why is the sky blue?
If you could travel to Earth from somewhere else in the universe, the first thing you'd 
notice from far away is a blue dot surrounded by totally black space. As you drew closer 
you'd see that it's blue and white with some brown and green parts. Entering the 
atmosphere, you'd see the sky around you change from black to a deep blue, and maybe 
to a hazy blue if you landed near the ocean or in a populated area. We take the blue sky 
for granted, but it's really quite unusual compared to the rest of the known universe.
Since the first experimental rocket planes began flying to the edge of space in the 
1950s, we've been seeing photos of the black space high above Earth. The photos of 
Earth with the most impact, however; were taken from 240,000 miles away on Dec. 24, 
1968 as the Apollo 8 spacecraft carrying astronauts Frank Borman, James Lovell and 
William Anders swung around the moon. Their photos showed Earth floating in the total 
blackness of space. The Earth from here is a grand oasis to the vastness of space, Lowell 
radioed back.
The blue and white we see from space are caused by the atmosphere, clouds and the 
oceans. Yet, there's nothing with a blue pigment in the air or water. And if you looked at 
the individual water droplets or the simple ice crystals that make up clouds they'd be 
clear, not white.
The blue sky white clouds and most of the other colors we see in the sky result from 
light being sent off in different directions as the light collides with air molecules, other 
substances or the water and ice of clouds. More than 12 miles above the Earth, the sky 
begins turning dark because there are fewer molecules to send light off in different 
directions. From space, if you look toward the sun you see its light; if you look elsewhere 
you see only black sky, stars and maybe the moon.
To understand why the sky is blue and clouds white, you have to realize that the 
white light from the sun consists of all the colors of the rainbow. Light travels as waves 
of different lengths. Each color has its unique wavelength.
You also have to know that light will travel in a straight line unless something sends 
it off in a different direction. As it turns out, air molecules are just the tight size to send 
the shorter wavelengths of light, mostly blue, off in different directions. Longer waves, 
such as red, are not scattered by air molecules.
As white sunlight enters the atmosphere the blue light is scattered by air molecules. 
The blue light waves spread all over the sky and down in all directions. No matter which 
way you look, blue light (the scattered blue light waves) is coming at you from that 
direction.
On hazy days large numbers of relatively large particles in the air make the sky white 
or gray. Larger particles scatter more wavelengths of light. Hazy air has plenty of 
moisture and condensation nuclei. Moisture condensing onto nuclei makes drops large 
enough to scatter all wavelengths. Sometimes pollution can make the sky appear brown 
or yellow because the particles are the right size to scatter those colors. When cold, dry 
air moves in, the sky turns a deep blue because there are few large particles to scatter 
other colors.
Clouds are white because their water droplets or ice crystals are big enough to scatter 
light of all wavelengths, which combine to produce white light. Clouds appear dark when 
they're in the shadow of other clouds, or when the top of a cloud is casting a shadow on 
its own base. How dark a cloud appears also depends on the background; the same cloud 
will look dark when it's surrounded by bright sky, lighter when it's in front of darker 
clouds.
Dark clouds aren't necessarily rain clouds. Rainy or snowy days are often dark 
because clouds block sunlight.

The sky at twilight
The sky turns red, orange or yellow at sunrise and sunset because light is traveling 
through more air when the sun is low in the sky. The long path through the air means 
most of the blue and colors with shorter wavelengths have been scattered in different 
directions. Few reach your eye. You see the yellow, orange and red colors, which pass 
more freely through the air.
Clean air brings orange sunsets because both yellow and red light travel through the 
air. Sunsets are especially vivid when red light reflects off clouds overhead. Volcanoes, 
and sometimes forest fires, bring the most vivid sunsets, however. Both produce particles 
that are just the right size to scatter light at the red end of the spectrum. The drawing at 
the bottom of Page 154 shows how this works.
Twilight is the period when the sun is below the horizon but we still see light in the 
sky. Civil twilight is the time from sunset - when the top of the sun drops below the 
horizon - until the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon. In general, the end of civil twilight 
is when lights are needed for outdoor activities. Street lights come on. Astronomical 
twilight lasts until the sky is dark enough to see faint stars; no sunlight is seen on the 
western horizon. The end of astronomical twilight occurs when the sun is 18 degrees 
below the horizon.
You continue seeing light in the sky long after it's dark on the ground. As anyone 
who has ever been in an airplane at sunset has seen, night doesn't fall, it rises from the 
ground as the sun dips farther below the western horizon.
In the tropics, twilight is relatively brief because the sun is following a path nearly 
perpendicular to the horizon. It takes little time to reach 6 degrees and then 18 degrees 
below the horizon.
In the summer, twilight becomes longer the farther from the equator you go because 
the sun is setting at an angle to the horizon. It takes longer to reach 6 degrees and then 18 
degrees below the horizon. In the far north or south during the summer; when the nights 
are very short, evening twilight lasts long enough to merge into morning twilight, 
creating the white nights of Scandinavia and Russia.
Vivid, normal sunset and sunrise colors result from sunlight traveling long distances 
through the atmosphere with various colors being scattered by different lands of particles 
in the air and reflected from clouds.

The sun's long beams
Often you'll see bright rays, or sun beams crossing the sky. These are crepuscular 
rays, created by particles in the air scattering light back to you. Sunlight scattered by dust 
in a darkened room creates the same effect. Sometimes you also see dark bands crossing 
the sky. These are shadows from clouds or mountains, sometimes ones below the horizon 
when the sun is low. Crepuscular rays seem to spread out, but they are really parallel. It is 
a matter of perspective. The rays seem to come together in the distance for the same 
reason railroad tracks converge at the horizon.

The glories of sky watching
One of the best places to watch the sky is from the sky. An airplane is the perfect sky 
observatory. Later in this chapter we'll discuss clouds. For now, let's consider some 
optical phenomena you see from the air or ground.
If you are sitting on the opposite side of the plane from the sun and you can see the 
plane's shadows on clouds below you might see a pale ring of colored red light around 
the shadow. This is the glory. The only other likely place to see a glory is from high on a 
sunlit mountain when you're looking at your shadow on fog below. The glory is caused 
by sunlight hitting water drops, traveling around the drops and then coming back toward 
the sun. Light waves of different colors are bent at slightly different angles, giving the 
glory its colors. If the plane is high enough above the clouds, you might see only the 
glory, not the plane's shadow.
Sometimes you also see the shadow of your plane's contrails - the long cloud that 
sometimes trails behind high-flying airplanes.
Recognizing what you see in the sky takes some practice. Even a Ph.D. degree in 
meteorology won't guarantee that you'll understand everything. Margaret LeMone, a 
National Center for Atmospheric Research scientist, offers an example. I was flying in a 
jet and the glory was just a blob of light without the rainbow color. And you could see the 
shadow of the contrail. It looked like this ball of fire with black smoke coming out of it. It 
was wonderful. I said, 'Wow, is this a UFO?'
Sometimes you can see rainbows as well as glories from airplanes. While a rainbow 
from the ground is an arc, from an airplane you might see the rainbow's entire circle.
 When the sun is on your side of the airplane, or when you're looking in the sun's 
direction from the ground, you might see coronas, halos, or sun dogs. 

The play of light on water, ice
Sun shining through clouds with water droplets creates circular splotches of light 
around the sun and moon known as coronas. Clouds of ice crystals create rings of light 
known as halos. You often see them when a layer of high, thin clouds covers the sky. Ice 
crystals can also create other kinds of rings and spots of light in the sky.
The most common kinds of spots of light, which are seen on one or both sides of the 
sun when it's low in the sky, are known as mock suns, sun dogs or parhelia. Halos and 
mock suns are relatively common. But if you point them out to most people, they'll tell 
you they've never noticed them before. How often you see halos or sun dogs depends on 
the cloudiness of your sky. But across the eastern United States you can expect to see 
them at least once a week on the average, especially in winter and early spring. Other 
kinds of ice crystal displays are relatively rare. Some of these are shown in the drawings 
on page 157.
LeMone tells about once seeing a rare circumhorizontal arc - a rainbow-like ring 
running around the sky just above the horizon. I screamed, 'Oh, look at that.' People 
around me wondered what was going on. Most of those people probably thought that 
circumhorizontal arc was a low rainbow. But you have to be looking away from the sun 
to see a rainbow. To appreciate the sky's rarest displays, you have to be familiar with its 
more common sights.

Meteorology, more than weather
Today the word meteorology has come to mean the study of weather but the word 
goes back to the Greeks, who used it to mean the study of natural phenomena above the 
Earths surface and below the sphere of the moon's orbit. The philosopher Plato is often 
credited as the first to use the word.
Big research projects to learn more about clouds are justified by the benefits they'll 
bring in improved weather forecasts or a clearer understanding of how the climate might 
be changing. No one launches expensive research projects to understand more about 
glories, halos or rainbows.
While meteorology today means study of weather and climate, the word meteor 
commonly refers to the streaks of light created when meteoroids, tiny particles from 
space, enter the atmosphere and burn up. But such shooting stars are really just one kind 
of meteor. Strictly speaking, a meteor is any natural phenomena in the atmosphere.

The Greeks recognized three types of meteors: Aerial referred to the winds; aqueous 
referred to rain, hail, sleet and snow; and luminous referred to rainbows, halos, northern 
lights and meteoroid trails. The Greeks also included comets, which we know are far out 
in space, because they thought comets were within their meteorology boundaries between 
the Earth and moon.

Rainbows are always special
Rainbows are the most noticeable meteor next to clouds, rain and snow. Many 
cultures have attached a religious significance to rainbows. In Genesis the rainbow is 
described as the sign of a covenant between God and Noah after the Flood that the waters 
shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
Greeks associated rainbows with the goddess Iris. In the Iliad, Homer tells how 
Aphrodite, wounded by Diomedes, fled to Olympus along the rainbow, carried by Iris. 
The Greek goddess Iris gives us not only the word iris for the colored part of the eye and 
a flower, but also the word iridescence. While in Genesis, the rainbow is a sign of God's 
mercy, the Greeks saw a sinister side. Iris is sometimes a hostile force that brings war and 
turbulence.
Most of us have heard the legend that if you can get to the end of the rainbow; you'll 
find a pot of gold; this is an old European tradition. But in some African mythology, the 
rainbow is a giant snake that brings bad luck to the house it touches. Many peoples have 
seen rainbows as bridges to heaven. According to a medieval German tradition, 
presumably based on the account in Genesis, no rainbows would be seen 40 years before 
the end of the world. Every time you saw a rainbow you could be sure the world would 
last at least another 40 years.
The beginning of what we could consider scientific explanations of rainbows goes back 
to the Greek philosopher Anaximenes, who lived around 575 B.C. He thought rainbows 
resulted from a mixture of sunlight and the blackness of clouds. Various explanations 
were tried over the years with little success. French philosopher and mathematician Rene 
Descartes (1596-1650) worked out the geometry of how water drops bend light waves, 
one of the important ideas that led to our understanding of rainbows. Isaac Newton 
(1642-1727) discovered that different colors are bent different amounts by a prism, such 
as a drop of water. It is this prism effect of water that explains how raindrops break white 
sunlight into the colors of the rainbow.

Sorting out clouds
While conditions have to be exactly right to see a glory, a halo or a rainbow from a 
plane, you are always sure to see clouds. If you know even a little about weather, clouds 
help tell you what the atmosphere is doing along your plane's route.
Flat clouds indicate stable air. Piled up clouds, unstable air. If you're flying toward a 
warm front, you'll see the clouds grow thicker as shown in the drawing on page 47.
Since airliners avoid thunderstorms, a flight is often the best way to see spectacular 
clouds such as a supercell or a row of towering thunderstorms in a squall line. The photo 
on the bottom left of the page 164 shows what a supercell looks like from an airliner. 
Haze, other clouds or precipitation usually hide the full magnificence of such clouds from 
the ground.
In 1803, English scientist Luke Howard devised the basic system of cloud 
classification we still use. While some people today might find the Latin names difficult, 
the system has stood for nearly 200 years as a logical way to sort out clouds. It 
distinguishes clouds in two ways: by their general appearance and by their height above 
the ground.
There are two pans to understanding how clouds get their names. Start with the basic 
shapes:
?	Cirrus are curly or fibrous;
?	Stratus are layered or stratified;
?	Cumulus are piled up or lumpy
The second part of understanding cloud names is based on the height of the clouds:
?	Cirro is the prefix given to high clouds, those with bases above around 20,000 feet 
in middle latitudes.
?	Alto is the prefix for middle-level clouds with bases from around 6,000 feet to 
20,000 feet.
?	Nimbo added to the beginning or nimbus added to the end of a cloud's name means 
that cloud is producing precipitation.
As you can see, the system isn't uniform; for example, there's no prefix for low 
clouds. And there are some odd mixtures; the name stratocumulus combines words 
for two different shapes. But, that is a good description of these clouds.
Using the system, we see that a cirrocumulus cloud is a cloud that's lumpy while a 
cirrostratus cloud is a high cloud that's flat.
A cumulonimbus cloud is producing rain. These clouds make thunderstorms.
Nimbostratus are low-layered clouds that are producing precipitation.
Clouds are important to understanding weather because they don't just happen. A 
particular cloud has a certain shape and location because of the movements of the air and 
the amount of water vapor and condensation nuclei in that air. As we saw in Chapter 5, 
stable air will tend to produce stratus clouds and unstable air will tend to produce 
cumulus clouds.
Most sky guides give pictures of clouds with their Latin names. But when you try to 
compare what you see in the sky with the photos in the books, you may find that little of 
what you're seeing seems to match the pictures.
The trick is to look for general characteristics - not precise matches. Are the clouds 
mostly lumpy or flat? Do they seem to be high in the sky or almost on the ground? 
Learning how to tell one kind of cloud from another is like learning how to tell one kind 
of bird from another; or one kind of tree from another. Before you start learning, you 
notice only a few broad differences between different birds, or trees, or clouds. But then 
as you look more closely you will discern tiny differences you never saw before.

What goes on high overhead
While most of the clouds and other meteors we see in the sky are in the troposphere, 
- the layer of air from the ground up to around 40,000 feet in the middle latitudes - the 
higher reaches of the atmosphere produce their own important and fascinating 
phenomena.
The boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere is known as the 
tropopause. This boundary which varies from around six to 10 miles above the surface, is 
the altitude at which the air's temperature stops falling and begins rising. Temperatures 
here range from about –50 F down to more than –100 F with the coldest temperatures 
over the equator, not over the poles as you might expect. In the tropics strong convection 
pumps warm air high into the sky. The air cools as it rises and pushes the tropopause to 
its highest altitude.
Since the stratosphere's temperatures are warmer than those below, the air is stable. 
In Chapter 5 we saw how an inversion, a layer of warm air over cold air; is stable, which 
means rising air stops rising unless it's being forced upward. While some thunderstorms 
push their tops into the stratosphere, little air from lower altitudes mixes with air at that 
level. Thunderstorm tops push through the tropopause because of the momentum of air 
racing upwards in their updrafts. It's like a rocket that keeps on rising for a while after its 
fuel bums out.
In Chapter 2 we saw how the sun's energy warms the ground and ocean, which in 
turn warm the air next to the ground. The greater the distance from the ground, the colder 
the air usually becomes. The exceptions are when the air near the ground cools more 
quickly than air above, for example on clear nights, or when extratropical cyclones or 
thunderstorms push up warm air and bring down cool air. So, if the air cools as it goes 
up, what warms the stratosphere?
The interaction between some of the sun's ultraviolet rays and ozone warms the 
stratosphere. In Chapter 12 we'll take a closer look at what's going on in this critical 
ozone layer. In brief, ozone absorbs ultraviolet light. Anything that absorbs energy is 
heated, which accounts for the temperatures in the + 40 F range at the top of the 
stratosphere, around 30 miles up.
While the stratosphere and the upper troposphere would be deadly places for an 
unprotected human, we travel through them on almost all jet airplane trips. The thin air 
that would kill us in a few minutes if we didn't have a supply of oxygen, is friendly to jet 
engines; it's the region where they perform most efficiently.
Above the stratosphere, in the mesosphere, which extends from about 30 miles to 
around 50 miles, the temperature fills again, cooling to below –150 F at its top. Another 
warm layer, the thermosphere, comes next. In this layer various atoms are absorbing 
ultraviolet and other kinds of solar energy.
Temperatures can range above 3,600 F in the thermosphere if the sun is in one of its 
periods with many sunspots and solar flares. This activity creates charged particles, 
which affect radio transmissions. That's why this layer, along with the higher level of the 
mesosphere, also is called the ionosphere - ions are electrically charged particles. The 
lowest region of the ionosphere, called the D Region, absorbs many radio waves while 
other regions reflect radio waves. The D Region weakens and disappears at night, 
allowing radio waves to bounce off the ionosphere. This is why you often can pick up 
distant radio stations at night.
We, like the ancient Greeks, can see the auroras and shooting stars as meteoroids 
burn up as they enter the atmosphere. Most of the things going on at the top of the 
atmosphere, however, are known to us only because of their effects on radio waves or 
through measurements made by satellites and research balloons.
However, most of the phenomena that make the sky a day-to-day entertainment - the 
wide variety of clouds, rainbows, halos, coronas and glories - take place in the 
troposphere, the bottom layer of the atmosphere where we live.
