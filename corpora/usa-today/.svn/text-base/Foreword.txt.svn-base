Everybody talks about the weather, but few people understand it. Weather is far 
more than a few numbers and lines across a map of the USA.
Clouds, for instance, are part of massive weather systems, not just window dressing 
for the sky.
Rain is more than water falling from the sky. It's the result of a complex chain of 
events - literally millions each second -happening inside clouds.
Lightning is not only deadly, but it is also at the center of some of today's most 
intricate scientific mysteries.
Today we have immediate access to unprecedented amounts of weather information. 
We need some way to sort out what is important in the Highs and Lows, Jet Streams and 
Dew Points that we hear or read about every day.
Use this book as a guide, an introduction to today's science of weather and climate. 
You can dip into the book at any point or you can start with some science basics in 
Chapters 1 through 5.
Meteorology is based on mathematics and physics, but you won't find a lot of 
equations and laws of physics in this book. This doesn't mean that the science of weather 
is like a simple jigsaw puzzle. The science of weather is an intricate, sometimes 
exasperating, puzzle with countless pieces that interact and change among themselves.
Meteorology also is a community of men and women, working on different parts of 
this great puzzle. In this book you will meet some of these people, including many 
leaders in the field.
In a sense, this book is a report on the atmospheric sciences community as it moves 
into the 21st century. As the 20th century ends, these scientists are adding a new focus: 
how man is affecting the very climate of the Earth.
The time and patience of many members of the atmospheric sciences community 
made this book possible. Those who contributed most directly are listed on page 208.
Special mention should go to Stanley D. Gedzelman of the City College of New 
York who acted as an advisor, suggesting improvements both in the science and in the 
writing. If this book sparks an interest in meteorology, Gedzelman's college-level, 
introductory textbook, The Science and Wonders of the Atmosphere, is a good place to 
begin. Much of the credit for scientific accuracy should go to Gedzelman and the other 
scientists who helped. Any errors are the author's.
Ira Geer; director of the education program for the American Meteorological 
Society, also deserves special mention. When the author; then a newspaper copy editor, 
began part-time math and science studies at the State University of New York College at 
Brockport in 1979, Geer's course released a latent interest in meteorology. In 1981 when 
the author began working with prototypes of the USA TODAY Weather Page, Geer had 
many useful suggestions. The page's big weather map can be traced back to exercises in 
his laboratory course. Since then he has encouraged the idea of a book like this one.
Several Weather Services Corporation meteorologists have contributed to the book 
by furthering the author's meteorological education over the years as he talked with them 
about Weather Page graphics and stories.
Many people at USA TODAY made the book possible beginning with the 
newspaper's editor, Peter Prichard, who agreed to commit the necessary staff during a 
year when the newspaper's resources were strained by news events such as the Gulf War 
and the breakup of the Soviet Union. The book is an outgrowth of USA TODAY's 
Weather Page - and its graphics - which have focused on individual aspects of weather 
each day since the paper's first edition, Sept. 15, 1982.
The graphics were conceived by the book's author and all were drawn by USA 
TODAY's talented artists under the direction of Richard Curtis, USA TODAY's 
managing editor for graphics and photography. As the overall designer of USA TODAY 
he helped conceptualize the newspaper's Weather Page. As the overall manager and 
designer of this book, he kept all involved directed toward producing a high-quality, 
graphically exciting product.
As the book's editor, Carol Knopes of USA TODAY's Special Projects Department, 
helped clarify the original, sometimes vague, ideas about the nature of the book and about 
how topics should be approached. She has a talent for encouraging a writer's best efforts.
Jeff Dionise, the book's primary artist, and other USA TODAY artists, did a 
magnificent job of translating the author's sketches and verbal descriptions into illus-
trations that give a rare and forceful vision to this book.
Alexandra Korab of USA TODAY's Graphics and Photography Department 
coordinated the original photos, including those of the scientists profiled. She also 
gathered photos to illustrate both historical events and atmospheric phenomena.
Researcher Cathy Hairier contributed the historical information in the book and 
supplied a high level of organization needed to coordinate this effort.
Copy editors were Jacqueline Blais and Walt Rykiel of the USA TODAY Special 
Projects Department and Theresa Barry of Gannett News Service. The author, as a one-
time copy editor, appreciates the contributions of editors who catch errors and improve 
both the details and the overall direction of any piece of writing.
Also contributing to this book from USA TODAY were: Julia Wallace, managing 
editor of the Special Projects Department; Lynne Perri, J.L. Albert and Steve Garment of 
the Graphics and Photography Department; and Robert Aronson and Jay Embree of the 
Color Imaging Department.
Thanks also go to our editors at Vintage Books, particularly Marty Asher; vice 
president and editor-in-chief whose personal interest in weather sparked this book, and to 
Linda Rosenberg, managing editor; whose fine editing skills improved the work.
The source of information on U.S. climate, such as the wettest and driest cities, is the 
National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C., which is staffed by knowledgeable 
meteorologists who went out of their way to supply information.
Journalists rarely have good words for public relations people, but that is because 
they haven't worked with the public relations staffs at the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, including the National Weather Service, and at the National 
Center for Atmospheric Research. Since 1982, the author has found these public affairs 
officers to be total professionals. Their aid with the book has confirmed that opinion.
No book such as this one can be written without access to first-rate libraries. USA 
TODAY's library was our starting point. The helpful staff could always be relied upon to 
come up with facts or to obtain books through interlibrary loan, especially from the 
Library of Congress. We also made extensive use of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration library in Rockville, Md., where the staff always made us 
feel welcome.
Finally, the book would not have been possible without the constant, loving support 
of my beloved wife, Darlene. Her sunny disposition always evaporates any storm clouds 
that peek above the horizon.
