Winds created by the sun's unequal heating of the Earth would blow across an unlivable planet if 
air were perfectly dry. The Earth is livable because, even in the driest places, the air always carries at 
least a little water. Not only does water in the air bring needed rain, the changes among its three phases 
- ice, liquid and vapor help create much of our weather.
If the air were perfectly dry, dust storms would blow across the Earth, but the planet would see 
neither rain nor snow. We wouldn't have thunderstorms or hurricanes or rainbows.
Water vapor, the invisible gaseous form of water that's always in the air, supplies the water 
needed for dew clouds, fog, rain and drizzle. Frost and frozen precipitation also depend on air's water 
vapor.
As we'll see in this chapter; changes of water among its three phases either add heat or take heat 
from the surrounding air. Air warmed or cooled by phase changes is a source of weather energy.

What happens in phase changes
To understand how water creates clouds and precipitation and how water adds or subtracts heat 
from the air as it changes among its three phases. Start with a close look at water molecules and see 
how they interact as ice, as liquid and as vapor.
Molecules are always moving. A substance's temperature depends on how fast the molecules are 
moving. The faster the molecules move, the hotter the substance. Temperature is one of the factors that 
determine whether a substance is a solid, liquid or gas.
When we talk about speeds of molecules changing with temperature, we're talking about averages. 
In a glass of cold water the average speed of molecules is lower than in a glass of hot water. In either 
case, if you could beam a state trooper's radar gun at each water molecule, you'd find a variety of 
speeds with some faster than average, some slower.
Imagine you are measuring the speed of one of the water molecules in a glass of water. If it's 
moving faster than the average speed, you might see it break free of the liquid water and fly into the 
air. It has enough energy to break the attractive force that had been holding it in the liquid.
As you warm up the glass of water, more vapor molecules will gain the energy needed to break 
free.
The drawings below simplify what happens when evaporation and condensation take place. 
Understanding what's happening in the simple cases here provides the basis for understanding what 
happens in clouds and storms.
As shown in the drawings, if evaporation continues long enough, the number of vapor molecules 
rejoining the water becomes equal to the number leaving the water. We say the air is saturated. As the 
drawings also show, when the air and water are warm, more vapor molecules are needed to reach this 
saturation point than when the air and water are cold. This is why warm air is said to hold more vapor 
than cold air.
Some scientists and science teachers don't like to talk about warm air holding water vapor because 
that can give the wrong idea that air holds water like a basket holds apples. But in the atmosphere's 
basket the apples are all moving. Warm air can hold more water vapor than cool air because in warm 
air more molecules are going fast enough to remain as vapor instead of condensing into liquid water. 
Water-vapor molecules are not locked into the air; they aren't being held there. In fact, they're entering 
and leaving the air all the time.

Keep the term saturated in mind. It's needed to explain a lot of things about humidity. Air is saturated 
when any additional vapor will condense if it gets the chance. Air that's saturated won't hold any more 
water vapor.
If we took the top off the container in the drawing on the previous page and blew dry air over it, 
more water would evaporate. Instead of staying in the container and becoming saturated, the air would 
blow away, taking water vapor with it. When more dry air continuously comes in contact with the 
water, the air doesn't become saturated, it blows away before that happens. This is why water 
evaporates faster on dry; windy days than on humid, still days.
Looking at water and vapor on the molecular level also helps explain why evaporation cools 
things. To break away and become vapor; a molecule has to acquire energy. Surrounding heat supplies 
that energy. In effect, a molecule that evaporates is carrying some of the heat from the liquid it's just 
left. When you perspire, the water your sweat glands deposit on your skin has been warmed by your 
body. When this water evaporates, it carries away heat.
Exercising when the air is nearly saturated is uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous. Little 
perspiration evaporates into nearly saturated air; which means little heat is carried away. You aren't 
cooled.
Just the opposite happens when the air is dry, especially if it's windy After a swim on a hot, dry; 
windy day, water quickly evaporates from your body It can carry away so much heat that you get 
goose bumps even if the temperature is 90 F.

Measuring humidity
The measure of humidity used must often is relative humidity. To explain it, we'll start with some 
other ways of measuring the air's humidity and then show what relative humidity is all about.
Meteorologists use various ways of describing how much water vapor is in the air. Here we are 
going to do some exercises using the saturation amounts chart below.
The chart shows how many cubic inches of water vapor are needed to saturate a cubic yard of air 
at various temperatures. This chart has been converted from metric units that all scientists use. It 
ignores slight changes in water density associated with temperature changes. It assumes that a cubic 
centimeter of water is one gram.
The drawing shows just how little water is in even the most humid air: If you could squeeze all 
the water out of a cubic yard of saturated 95 F air; you'd have only 1.85 cubic inches of water - about 
one-eighth of a measuring cup.
Now use the chart to explain one of the most important measures of humidity, the dew point. Try 
this problem: Imagine the 3 p.m. temperature is 86 F with 0.6 cubic inches of water vapor for each 
cubic yard of air.
Now, imagine what happens as the sun sets and the temperature begins cooling. Let's assume that 
no water vapor is added or taken away from the air as it cools. What happens when the air cools to 59 
F. The chart shows that at 59 F air with 0.6 cubic inches of water vapor per cubic yard is saturated. 
Any further cooling means that water vapor would begin condensing out of the air into liquid water. 
Since the ground cools first, water would begin condensing onto the grass to form dew.
Back at 3 p.m. when we saw how much water was in the air, we could have said: If the air is 
cooled below 59 F, the air would be saturated and dew would begin forming. In other words, 59 F is 
the air's dew point.
Hourly weather observations from around the world don't give the relative humidity; they give the 
dew point. The dew point temperature is based on how much water vapor is in the air. So while dew 
point is given in terms of temperature, it's really a measure of humidity.
 
What relative humidity tells you

The chart at the left also helps explain what relative humidity means. Go back to the 3 p.m. 
observation of a temperature of 86 F with 0.6 cubic inches of water vapor per cubic yard of air. The 
chart shows that 86 F air needs 1.42 cubic inches of vapor per cubic yard to be saturated. Divide the 
actual vapor in the air (0.6 cubic inches) by the amount the air could hold (1.42 cubic inches) and mul-
tiply by 100. That percentage shows what share of the vapor the air could hold is actually in the air. 
This is relative humidity. In this case the air has 42 percent of the water vapor it could hold at its 
current temperature.
Relative humidity depends not only on how much water vapor is in the air, but also on the air's 
temperature. This explains why relative humidities are higher at night, when the air is cooler; than 
during the day even though the amount of water vapor in the air doesn't change.
The relative humidity table at the right shows how this works. The amount of vapor in the air was 
measured at 3 p.m. when the temperature was 86 F. As the air cools, no water vapor is being added or 
taken away. The table shows how the relative humidity increases as the air cools, even though the 
amount of water vapor in the air stays the same.

Why your house dries out in winter
The saturation table on the previous page makes it easy to sec why the air inside buildings 
becomes so dry in the winter.
Imagine it's a cold, damp day with the outside air at 32 F and that the air is saturated. According to 
the chart, saturated 32 F air has 0.23 cubic inches of water vapor per cubic yard. Now, bring some of 
this 32 F outside air inside and warm it up to 68 F without turning on the humidifier. The air is 
warmed, but there's still only 0.23 cubic inches of water vapor per cubic yard. What's its relative 
humidity? Take the 0.23 cubic inches of vapor actually in the air and divide it by the amount of vapor 
68 F air can hold, 0.81 cubic inches. Multiply by 100 and you get a relative humidity of 28 percent. A 
comfortable range is usually 40 to 70 percent.
The colder the outside air, the worse it gets because the air has even less water vapor in it. It's not 
on our chart, but air at 5 F can hold only 0.07 cubic inches of vapor per cubic yard. Bring that air 
inside and warm it to 68 F without adding any humidity and the relative humidity would be only 9 
percent.

Heat and water's phase changes
A liquid molecule needs energy to break its bonds and become vapor. Imagine a water molecule 
evaporating from your skin on a hot day. It gains the needed energy by taking a tiny amount of energy 
from your skin, which helps cool you off. This heat doesn't disappear, it's converted into the vapor 
molecule's added energy. As the vapor molecule moves away from your body, it takes this energy 
called latent heat with it.
When the vapor molecule condenses back into liquid, it releases the latent heat, warming its 
surroundings. Imagine the molecule that evaporated from your body rising to join billions of water 
vapor molecules condensing into the tiny drops of a cloud. When the molecule condenses, it releases 
the latent heat carried from your body, helping to warm the air slightly in the growing cloud. This 
release of latent heat might not sound like much, but it's the major source of energy for hurricanes.
Latent heat also is involved when water freezes or ice melts. To turn water into ice, your 
refrigerator must pump away heat to cool the water to the freezing point and then continue pumping 
away the latent heat released as the water freezes. To melt, ice must take in enough heat for its 
molecules to gain energy to break their crystal bonds. In a glass of iced tea, for instance, this energy 
comes from the warm tea. Energy going from the tea into the ice accounts for most of the tea's 
cooling.
Water makes two other kinds of phase changes: directly from vapor into ice and directly from ice 
to vapor In the United States, meteorologists usually call both changes sublimation. Frost is a good 
example of vapor sublimating directly into ice. Sometimes after snow falls the sun comes out but the 
air stays very cold and dry. Piles of snow just seem to disappear without any melting; the snow is 
sublimating directly to vapor in the dry air. Sublimation, like the other phase changes, also involves 
latent heat. When vapor sublimates into ice, heat is added to the surroundings. When ice sublimates 
into vapor; heat is taken from the surroundings.

Effects of water vapor in the air
Understanding how water acts as it evaporates (or sublimates) into the air or condenses (or 
sublimates) out of the air helps explain such things as why the bathroom mirror fogs up during a hot 
shower. It also explains how dew, frost, fog and clouds form.
A bathroom minor fogs up because some of the hot water spraying from the shower evaporates 
into the bathroom's air, increasing its humidity, and therefore the air's dew-point temperature. The 
mirror's surface is cooler than the dew point of the now-humid air in the bathroom. Some of the vapor 
in the air that touches the minor condenses onto it, making tiny water drops. Dew has formed on the 
mirror. If the shower is hot enough and the air already humid enough, a light fog might form in the 
room. The vapor is condensing into tiny drops that float in the air.
As we saw in Chapter 2, dew or frost and fog are more likely to form on clear nights than cloudy 
nights. The Earth is always radiating away infrared energy into the atmosphere. After the sun goes 
down, solar energy is no longer warming the ground, but the infrared energy keeps on sending heat 
upwards. The ground cools. When it's cloudy the clouds absorb infrared energy from the Earth and 
radiate it back down. On clear nights infrared energy is lost to space; the ground becomes cooler.  The 
cold ground cools the air next to it.

If the air cools to its dew point, dew, frost or fog form.


How frost forms
Water doesn't always doesn't turn to ice when it drops below 32 F. Such water is called 
supercooled water and we'll discuss it in detail in Chapter 7. At temperatures from 32 F to around 0 F 
water vapor condenses as supercooled dew and then turns to ice and frost. After that, vapor molecules 
begin sublimating directly from the air into the frost. This process of condensing as supercooled dew, 
turning to ice and then growing by sublimation accounts for many of the frost patterns we see on car 
windows. Sometimes dew condenses above 32 F but then the air turns colder, freezing the air. This 
frozen dew creates solid ice drops or a glaze of clear ice. Frost forms inside windows when the glass 
cools to the frost point of air inside the house or between the panes of a double window.

What the dew point tells you
When water vapor either condenses into liquid or sublimates directly into ice, it releases latent 
heat and warms the air a little. This means that overnight as the air cook to its dew point, condensation 
will begin slowing the temperature fall. As a result the air is not likely to get colder than its initial dew 
point anytime during the night. Of course the air doesn't always cool to the dew point. And, a mass of 
new cold air could move in during the night making the temperature plunge after the front passes and 
colder, drier air arrives. But if no fronts are expected to arrive overnight, the afternoon's dew point 
gives you an idea of what minimum temperature to expect that night. For instance, if you're 
vacationing in the Florida Keys and the afternoon temperature is 89 F and the dew point is 72 F you 
better make sure your motel has good air conditioning. That night's low temperature is going to be in 
the 70s and the relative humidity is going to be around 100 percent.
If the temperature and dew point are close together, in the late afternoon when the air's turning 
cooler, fog is likely during the night. This is why weather observations from airports include both the 
temperature and dew point. Pilots know that if the two are only 4 F or 5 F apart, fog is likely; they 
might not have good enough visibility to land.

Condensation in mid air
Getting condensation going in the air isn't as automatic as it might seem. We introduced 
evaporation and condensation on Page 62 with the special case of water in a container. After saturation 
was reached, vapor molecules began condensing back into the water. But in the atmosphere things do 
not happen so simply.
In clean air, condensations don't take place easily. Water drops would have to stick together after 
colliding, which is unlikely. Also, once they form, tiny water droplets are likely to fall apart.
The water vapor molecules need something to stick to. The things that enable water to condense 
into droplets in the air are called condensation nuclei. These arc tiny particles, such as sea salt, that 
attract water. They are so tiny that it's easiest to talk about them in terms of microns. A micron or 
micrometer is one millionth of a meter. A human hair is about 100 microns thick - about .004 inch. 
Most condensation nuclei arc about 0.1 micron in diameter; the largest are 10 microns.
Salt from the sea is important as condensation nuclei even 100 miles inland where it's carried by the 
wind. Salt shoots into the air when bubbles burst in the ocean. Wind also picks up salt when it blows 
foam off breaking waves. Relatively large salt particles explain the haze you often see right along the 
beach as water collects on the salt nuclei. Anyone who's lived near the ocean knows how the salty mist 
and dew quickly rust metal. Other condensation nuclei come from sand and dust blown into the air; 
particles In smoke from fires, material ejected by volcanoes and even tiny particles left when 
meteorites burn as they enter the atmosphere, creating shooting stars.
Material put into the air by people, pollution, can add to the condensation nuclei and condensation 
can begin when the relative humidity is only 65%. This can make polluted air hazy, but all hazy air 
isn't polluted. In fact, haze is likely in clean air when the humidity is close to 100 percent.

When does water freeze?
Many believe that water freezes at 32 F; but that's not always true. Another complication of how 
water acts in the atmosphere. As water cools, the molecules begin going slowly enough to line up as 
six-sided ice crystals. But they need a pattern on which to form.
Molecules can come together by chance into the six-sided form, supplying the needed pattern. Or, 
a freezing nucleus, a bit of foreign matter such as clay or vegetation debris in the water may provide 
an ice pattern.
While it may contain many freezing nuclei, a relatively large amount of water, such as in a 
freezer's ice tray, also is likely to have molecules come together into an ice crystal by chance. But in 
the atmosphere, the odds are astronomical against molecules coming together by chance to form a six-
sided crystal. In fact, scientists have found that tiny water drops aren't sure to form ice until the 
temperature drops to –40 F.
In the atmosphere, though, water doesn't have to be cooled to -40 F to start making ice crystals. 
Freezing nuclei make the difference. Some, but not all of these particles, have a structure much like 
ice. Vapor or liquid water molecules hook on and grow into ice crystals.
Life becomes even more complicated when both ice crystals and water drops form in air at the 
same time. Once ice starts forming, such as in a cloud, it begins stealing water from the water droplets. 
Remember, water molecules are both coming and going between the liquid and vapor forms. The same 
is true for ice crystals, but there's an important difference. Once a water molecule hooks on as part of 
an ice crystal, it has a harder time escaping than another molecule that's become part of a drop of 
liquid water. As a result, more molecules leave the water drops than the ice crystals. If this goes on 
long enough, a cloud of mixed ice and water will turn into a cloud of ice crystals.

What shapes the clouds?
When air becomes saturated, its water vapor condenses into liquid or sometimes sublimates into 
ice. If the air that reaches its dew point is on the ground, or near the ground it forms dew, frost or fog. 
Air near the ground is most often cooled because it is in contact with the ground as the ground turns 
colder. As we saw in Chapter 2, the surface cools when it loses infrared energy to space, which is most 
likely when the sky is clear.
Air also cools whenever its pressure decreases. Any time air moves into an area of lower pressure, 
such as at a higher altitude, its pressure decreases and the air cools. Most clouds are created by air 
rising until it cools to the dew point. How the air happens to rise helps determine what the clouds look 
like. We'll spend the rest of this chapter focusing on clouds. We'll see why some clouds are puffy, 
often billowing high into the sky, while others are flat and form in layers. We'll look at why rain or 
snow falls in showers some days, steadily on others.
Air stability is the crucial factor determining cloud shapes and whether precipitation is showery or 
steady. Stable air tends to return to the state it was in before it was disturbed. Stable air that's forced 
upward tries to return to its original altitude after the disturbance ends. Unstable air continues in the 
path along which it was pushed. It tends to continue rising after the original force stops.
To begin understanding why the air is stable some-times, unstable at other times, we'll first take a 
closer look at why and how air cools as it rises. The drawings on page 69 explain why air cools as it 
rises and warms as it descends. In these sketches, the balloon is being carried up and then down - 
imagine someone climbing up and down a hill with the balloon.
A bubble of air rising without a balloon around it acts like the air in the balloon. Instead of moving 
with the air around it, the rising air bubble expands, doing work by pushing on the surrounding air. 
That pushing uses up energy and the air cools.

A key point: The temperature changes of rising and sinking air depend only upon how much the 
pressure increases or decreases. The temperature of the surrounding air doesn't affect the temperature 
of the air rising or sinking through it.
You can use a bicycle tire and tire pump to feel air cooling as it moves from higher pressure to 
lower pressure, warming as its pressure increases. Let the air out of the tire; it feels cool as it rushes 
out because its pressure is decreasing. Now, pump up the tire and notice how the pump warms. Little 
of that heat comes from friction in the pump, most comes from air being warmed as the pump 
compresses it.
Remember, the amount of cooling or heating depends only on the pressure change the air 
undergoes. For rising air; pressure change depends on the altitude gained or lost. Rising air cools at the 
rate of a 5.4 F per 1,000 feet and sinking air warms at the same rate.
This figure is the dry adiabatic lapse rate. Dry means water isn't changing from one phase to 
another in the air. Adiabatic means heat isn't being added or taken away; temperature changes result 
only from what the air itself is doing. Lapse rate means a rate of temperature change with altitude.
Cooling of rising air explains why low-pressure areas normally bring clouds and precipitation. As 
we saw in Chapter 4, surface air rises in low-pressure areas. When this rising air cools to its dew point, 
clouds begin forming.
High-pressure areas usually bring good weather because descending air gets warmer. In Chapter 
4, we saw how winds converging at middle and high levels of the atmosphere force air down, building 
high pressure at the surface. As the air descends, it warms. That keeps clouds from forming and 
evaporates any existing clouds.


This is the main reason why places under large, months-long high-pressure areas, such as the West 
Coast in the summer are mostly sunny and dry.
The warming of descending air causes winds to grow warmer and drier as they blow down 
mountains. Examples are the Santa Ana winds in California and the Chinook winds in the Rockies. As 
the wind comes down the mountains, its temperature increases, which means it can hold more water 
vapor. But there's hardly any water to evaporate into the air. The relative humidity drops.
California's Santa Ana winds often contribute to terrible grass fires. The winds, which come from 
the deserts and blow down into places such as the Los Angeles Basin, start out dry and end up with 
relative humidities in the single digits after warming as they blow downhill. This dries out vegetation. 
As the winds squeeze through canyons, their speeds increase. These winds can whip even tiny fires 
into roaring conflagrations.

The key to air stability
With the knowledge that rising air cools at the rate of 5.4 F per 1,000 feet - as long as water vapor 
isn't condensing - we're almost ready to see how meteorologists determine whether the air will be 
stable or unstable at a particular time and place.
The other thing we need to understand is that warm air is less dense than old air. The same 
volume of warm air weighs less than cold air at the same pressure.
This is why a hot-air balloon rises. As long as the pilot keeps the air in the balloon's envelope 
warmer than the surrounding air; the balloon will float. The pilot can make the balloon rise faster by 
turning on the burner; which warms the air in the envelope.
A bubble of air that's warmer than the surrounding air will float upward just like a hot air balloon. 
And as long as the bubble stays warmer than the surrounding air it will continue rising. Obviously 
there's a key difference between a hot air balloon and a bubble of rising air. The bubble, unlike the 
balloon, has no pilot to turn on the burner to keep it warmer than the surrounding air.
Since the bubble of rising air is cooling at a constant rate, the temperature of the surrounding air 
determines whether the bubble will keep on rising. If the surrounding air is cooler than the bubble, the 
bubble rises. The drawings at left are examples of stable and unstable air.
To determine whether the air is stable or unstable, you need to know the temperature of the air at 
regular intervals from the ground up. Such vertical profiles of air temperature usually are obtained by 
sending up weather balloons with instruments that radio back temperatures.
When you know the temperatures, you could do as we did in the drawings or page 70. Imagine a 
bubble of rising air cooling at the rate of 5.4 F per 1,000 feet and compare its temperatures with those 
of the surrounding air If the bubble stays warmer, it will keep on rising; the air is unstable. If it grows 
cooler than the surrounding air, the air is stable.
To make a prediction of what will happen in the next three or four hours, you have to figure out 
what the stability will be then. The drawing below is an example of how air can change from stable to 
unstable during the day.
If cold air moves in at higher altitudes, the air will become more unstable. At other times, as we 
saw in Chapter 4, a short wave or upper-air disturbance can move over an area. Such disturbances 
cause surface air to rise. The air cools as it rises and generates a pool of cooler air.
Here are two rules to remember: Relatively cold air on top of relatively warm air creates an 
unstable atmosphere. Relatively warm air atop relatively cold air creates a stable atmosphere.
On clear nights the ground cools the air near it, but has little effect on the air higher up. By dawn 
it's not unusual to have the air near the ground colder than the air a few hundred feet above. At other 
times, a layer of warm air can move in above cold air. These situations are called inversions. They're 
the opposite of the more usual case of the air being cooler at higher altitudes Inversions are extremely 
stable. Rising air will always be cooler - and therefore heavier - than the air above the inversion level, 
the layer of warm air. Since inversions block air from rising, they can trap pollution close.

How humidity affects air density
People sometimes have trouble believing that humid air is lighter than dry air, but it is. The reason 
is an important law of nature discovered in the early 1800s by the Italian physicist Amadeo Avogadro. 
A fixed volume of gas - say one cubic foot - at the same temperature and pressure will always have the 
same number of molecules no matter what gas is in the container. This is one of the keystones of 
chemistry.
Imagine a small container of perfectly dry air. It contains about 78 percent nitrogen; each 
molecule has an atomic weight of 28. Another 21 percent is oxygen; each molecule has an atomic 
weight of 32. The final one percent is various other gases, mostly argon.
The chart below on the right shows what happens if we add 10 water vapor molecules. Eight 
molecules of nitrogen and two of oxygen leave, keeping the total in the box the same. In this case, the 
total atomic weight would decrease by 108 as water replaces heavier air molecules.
Humid air is lighter than dry air at the same temperature and pressure because water molecules are 
lighter than the nitrogen and oxygen they displace.
Since humid air is lighter than dry air; it will tend to rise; it's a little more unstable. But the weight 
differences are so tiny - as shown in the drawing on the next page - that the effect on stability is minor.

How humidity affects stability
The amount of water vapor in the air does have an important effect on stability, however. Unless rising 
air is extremely dry, such as over deserts, it is likely to cool to its dew point while rising. When the air 
reaches its dew point, water vapor begins condensing onto nuclei in the air, forming tiny drops. A 
cloud begins forming.

As we've seen, when water vapor condenses it releases latent heat to its surroundings. Now there's 
a tug of war going on. The air containing the condensing water vapor is still rising, which means it's 
cooling. But the latent heat being released is trying to warm the air.
While the heat being added as water vapor condenses is never enough to prevent the air from 
cooling as it rises, it slows the rate of cooling. The rate that rising air cools when condensation is going 
on is called the moist adiabatic lapse rate. This rate varies, but a good average figure is about 3.3 F per 
1,000 feet.
The slower cooling rate means the rising air is even more likely to remain warmer than the 
surrounding air, and will continue rising. In other words, latent heat helps the air rise. It's like a fuel 
for thunderstorms. The humidity that makes spring and summer days uncomfortable also supplies 
energy to thunderstorms.

What stability means for weather
On an unstable das individual bubbles of air accelerate after receiving an upward shove of some 
kind. Unless the air is very dry, water vapor will condense into clouds. Since individual bubbles of air 
are rising, the clouds will be puffy. Their precipitation will be showery. Shallow layers of unstable air 
produce small, puffy clouds. But if there is a deep layer of unstable air, towering cumulus clouds or 
thunderstorms form.
When the air is stable, bubbles won't rise, but entire layers of air can be pushed upward. A warm 
front is a good example: warm air is being pushed upwards over cold air. Since the whole layer of air 
is being pushed upward the clouds that form are flat with a layered look.
Drawings on pages 74 and 75 show the key differences air stability makes on the weather.
The distinction between stable and unstable air isn't always sharp. Sometimes one layer of air may 
be stable while another above or below it is unstable. Or, the air can be on the borderline between 
stable and unstable. This is why sometimes flat clouds typical of stable air and billowing clouds that 
mark unstable air are in the sky at the same time.


What goes on in clouds

To someone who pays little attention to the sky', clouds might look simple: merely white puffs or 
gray smudges. When you begin looking closely at the sky; however; clouds present a bewildering 
variety of shapes and colors. As scientists came to learn more about clouds, they found them even 
more complicated than they might appear to the eye. Not many years ago many key questions about 
clouds seemed unanswerable.
Today, however, methods of probing clouds such as instrument-laden aircraft and Doppler radars 
that measure hidden, internal motions are answering many of the questions. A goal today is to learn 
enough about clouds to model them accurately with computers. This is important both for weather 
forecasts and understanding Earth's climate.
Clouds are made of tiny water droplets, tiny ice crystals, or both. Precipitation that falls from 
clouds is made up of larger water drops, ice crystals that have melted, or still-frozen crystals. 
Sometimes all three fall together.
Gravity pulls the cloud droplets toward the Earth like everything else. But, also like everything 
else, cloud droplets have a terminal velocity, the speed they reach when the upward force of air 
resistance matches the downward pull of gravity. Small water drops have a slower terminal velocity 
than large drops. For an average-size cloud droplet, the terminal velocity is less than two feet per 
minute, about 0.02 miles per hour.
The question of how a cloud made of water could float in the air was a big puzzle through the 
early 19th century. Many scientists argued that clouds must be composed of bubbles because bubbles 
would be able to float in the air. They didn't have a good understanding of the idea of terminal 
velocity, which makes it easy to see how the air can hold up water drops. Even if the updrafts 
supporting the tiny drops stop and the droplets start falling, they're so tiny they quickly evaporate into 
the surrounding air. For rain to begin falling, the drops must grow much larger. The drawing at right 
shows just how much bigger the average raindrop is compared to a cloud drop. While the average 
cloud droplet has a terminal velocity of only 0.02 miles per hour, an average raindrop falls at 14 miles 
per hour. In other words, as drops grow larger their terminal velocity increases.
At first glance, it might appear that condensation continues until the drops become big enough to 
start falling. But early in this century scientists realized that condensation alone isn't enough; it is too 
slow and could never produce rain-sized drops in a half hour. Yet showers are often seen falling 30 
minutes or less after the first wisps of a new cloud show up.
Between 1911 and the 1930s, scientists developed the theory that ice was the answer. As we saw 
on page 67, if ice crystals and water drops are mixed together in a cloud, the ice crystals will grow at 
the expense of the water droplets. In such a case, researchers said the ice crystals quickly could grow 
large enough to begin falling, melt on the way down, and hit the ground as rain.

Until World War II, meteorologists accepted the ice-crystal theory as accounting for most 
precipitation. The war, which sent meteorologists and their instruments into the tropics, showed that 
plenty of tropical rain falls from clouds that never produce below-freezing temperatures. Ice crystals 
couldn't account for their rain.
	So, it was back to the first question. How can cloud droplets grow big enough to fall? One answer 
is accretion - droplets bumping into each other and sticking together. This is how the planets were 
formed, chunks of matter in space came together. In a cloud, drops that grow this way would start 
falling faster. As they fell they could sweep up smaller drops they run into.
But there is a problem. The air flowing around a falling drop would push many smaller drops out 
of the way, reducing the number that collide with and join the bigger drops. Scientists are trying to 
discover just how efficient drops are at sweeping up smaller ones. They're also looking at how 
turbulence could mix up drops, causing them to collide and grow.
Clouds with no ice in them are called warm clouds. If part of a cloud is below freezing it's a cold 
cloud. Scientists are still working out the details of what happens in both warm and cold clouds.

The dream of weather modification
Modern weather modification began on Nov 13, 1946. On that day Vincent Schaefer, then with 
the General Electric Company laboratory in Schenectady N.Y, sprinkled three pounds of finely ground 
dry ice - solid carbon dioxide - from an airplane onto a laver of clouds near Albany. N.Y Five minutes 
later snowflakes were falling from the cloud. Several other experiments confirmed that dry ice 
produces billions of ice crystals heavy enough to fall from the cloud.
The next big step was taken by one of Schaefer's colleagues, Bernard Vonnegut, who discovered that 
introducing very small amounts of silver iodide smoke into supercooled clouds creates ice crystals. It 
works much like naturally-occurring freezing nuclei. Vonnegut decided to try silver iodide because its 
atoms have a crystal structure similar to ice crystals. Today, silver iodide is the main material used to 
enhance precipitation. It's an efficient ice nucleus.
Schaefer and Vonnegut worked for Irving Langmuir, the 1932 Nobel Prize winner in chemistry 
who had turned to cloud physics as a result of World War II research on aircraft icing. The 
experimental results and Langmuir's scientific credentials and enthusiasm helped make cloud seeding 
one of the newest hopes for a better life.
Respected scientists began talking about weather modification about not only squeezing more rain 
or snow from clouds, but also about feats such as turning hurricanes away from land. The federal 
government and some states began investing in research.
Federal involvement built to a peak in 1972 when Washington spent about $l8.6 million on 
weather modification research. But results weren't clear cut and scientists grew more aware of the 
complexity of clouds and storms. That, combined with pressures to cut government spending, led to 
federal weather modification spending being reduced to less than $3 million a year by 1990.
But weather modification isn't dead. Cloud seeding continues, particularly in California where 
every extra inch of rain or snow is vital. Today's cloud seeders make much more modest claims than 
their 19th century forerunners. For instance they talk about helping a storm produce 11 or 12 inches of 
snow instead of the 10 it would have made without help.
A few airports, mostly in the Northwest, use dry ice or silver iodide to clear fog. Sending a small 
plane or helicopter up to dispense fog works when the fog is colder than 32 F. The supercooled fog 
droplets turn to ice crystals and fail when they are seeded. Clearing fog that's warmer than 32 F is an 
unsolved problem. During World War II gasoline was burned on the edge of runways to warm the air 
above its dew point, evaporating the fog. It cleared the fog, allowing returning planes to land, but 
today the resulting air pollution would not be tolerated.

Clouds help control climate
The dream of weather modification spurred cloud research. And precipitation clouds at first 
seemed to be the most interesting. Why spend time with clouds that seemed to do little except cast 
shadows when you could be studying clouds that are busy producing rain, snow, hail, sleet, tornadoes 
or thunder and lightning?
Today, however, researchers are investing time and money in trying to understand clouds that 
used to be of little interest. High, thin cirrus clouds and the large, flat layers of lumpy stratocumulus 
clouds covering thousands of miles of ocean - the kind you see off the California Coast - are a key to 
predicting whether the Earth will warm up as we add more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.
Clouds can either warm or cool the Earth. Researchers are focusing on stratocumulus clouds over 
the oceans and cirrus clouds everywhere because these are the Earth's most widespread and most 
persistent. Clouds cool the Earth by reflecting sunlight back into space. They warm the Earth by 
absorbing infrared radiation and then re-radiating some of it back down. Which effect predominates 
depends on the nature of the cloud, including the size of its water drops and ice crystals.
The size of water drops or ice crystals depends among other things, on the amounts and lands of 
condensation or freezing nuclei in the air, the cloud's temperature and air turbulence. So scientists 
must look at microscopic processes such as water vapor condensing and sublimating as well as global-
scale weather patterns. The study of clouds has become a most important and complex part of the 
study of Earth's weather, its climate and its future.
