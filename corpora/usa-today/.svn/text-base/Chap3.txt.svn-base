Hot and cold air masses are only the beginning of weather. To create the constant 
panorama of changing skies, winds and temperatures, something has to set those air 
masses in motion. That something is air pressure - the force air exerts on everything it 
touches.
Air pressure is important for three reasons. It creates the wind - from the great seas 
of wind that blow hundreds of miles across the Earth to the lightest local sea breezes. Up 
and down movement of air in low- and high-pressure areas creates cloudy or clear skies. 
Finally, changes in air pressure give vital clues about what the weather will do over the 
next several hours.
Since the air's pressure at any one place rarely stays the same for long, the winds and 
weather are constantly changing.

What makes air pressure?
Even though we can't see it, air is real and has weight. It's made up mostly of 
molecules of nitrogen and oxygen. In the lower part of the atmosphere, air is about 78 
percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen with other gases accounting for the other one 
percent. Here we will use the term air molecules to refer to all molecules of all the gases 
in air. As in any gas, air molecules are zipping around at incredible speeds. Near the 
Earth's surface, they're traveling an average of about 1,600 feet per second or 1,090 mph. 
Warm up the air and the average speed increases: cool it off, and it slows down. Air 
molecules are bumping into and bouncing off each other - and anything else that gets in 
their way.
The impacts of those billions of bouncing molecules cause pressure. Imagine a 
bathroom scale attached to a wall. Now start throwing baseballs at the scale. The weight 
indicator jumps every time a bad hits it. It's showing the force of the ball colliding with 
the scale. If enough people lobbed enough baseballs at the scale, the indicator wouldn't 
have time to move down between hits. The balls would apply such constant pressure the 
indicator's tiny movements wouldn't be noticeable. What the indicator reports - the 
amount of force the balls are applying - would depend on how fast the baseballs are going 
and how frequently they are hitting the scale.
Right now, air molecules are bouncing off you from every direction. You don't feel 
each tiny impact because the air has so many extremely tiny molecules moving so 
quickly. Near the ground, a box one inch on each side would hold around 400 sextillion 
air molecules. That's 400 followed by 21 zeros.

Some rules of air pressure
Air pressure depends on the number of air molecules in a given space and how fast 
they're moving. Heating air - or any other gas - increases its pressure unless you give it 
more room. Cooling air will decrease its pressure, if it's kept in the same amount of 
space. Squeezing air into less space increases its pressure. Allowing air to expand into a 
larger space decreases pressure. Also, if you heated air and squeezed it into a smaller 
space at the same time, its pressure would zoom. The science behind all this is shown in 
the simple experiment below.

Air and gravity
Every molecule of air, even those 200 miles above the Earth where the atmosphere 
trails away to outer space, is being pulled downward by the force of gravity. So why 
aren't all of the air molecules pulled down into a huge clump of nitrogen and oxygen here 
at the surface? Air pressure is the answer.
Air molecules are zipping around creating pressure that pushes in all directions, 
including upward. That is how air pressure offsets gravity.
But gravity does have an effect. Pressure is greater at lower levels because the air's 
molecules are squeezed under the weight of the air above. At sea level, the average 
pressure is 14.7 pounds per square inch. Go up to 1,000 feet and it drops to about 14.1 
pounds per square inch. At about 18,000 feet, the pressure is 7.3 pounds per square inch; 
about half of the atmosphere's air molecules are below you; half above.

Air pressure aches
Since human beings evolved in an environment where the air pressure doesn't change 
rapidly, our bodies have trouble handling rapid decreases or increases in air pressure. 
That's why airplanes or even fast elevators can make us uncomfortable.
These quick changes in air pressure can cause several uncomfortable consequences:
Why do your ears pop as you go up or down in an airplane or a fast elevator? Air 
pressure inside and outside the middle ear normally is equal. But, as a person goes up, the 
outside pressure decreases, leaving the pressure inside the middle ear higher. The air 
inside the ear usually moves through the Eustachian tube to the throat, equalizing the 
pressure. However, if a person has a cold, the Eustachian tube might be blocked, making 
it harder for the air to leave the middle ear and causing a sense of fullness or pain.
Ear discomfort isn't the only symptom of pressure imbalance:
Sinuses arc cavities in the bones in the front of the skull. If their openings are 
stopped up, say by swelling caused by an allergy, pressure changes can cause pain as the 
higher pressure inside the sinuses presses against nerves. 
Gases in the stomach, for example from a carbonated drink, need to escape to lower 
pressure outside the body as you gain altitude.
Dental problems, such as a tooth abscess, can create tiny air pockets. When the air 
inside an abscess can't escape and presses against a tooth's nerve, the pain can be 
excruciating.
But there are far more serious side effects of a decrease in air pressure. If airplanes 
were not pressurized, as an airplane climbed, the decreasing air pressure would mean a 
decrease in oxygen.
Oxygen is vital to all the body, but oxygen depletion affects brain cells first with the 
most dangerous consequences, such as the loss of the ability to think clearly. Early 
symptoms of oxygen starvation - called hypoxia - vary from person to person. But 
eventually a victim becomes unconscious.
Most people who fly never have to worry about hypoxia because airliners are 
pressurized: the air pressure is kept at near-ground levels no matter how high the plane 
flies. For instance, the pressure in the cabin of an airliner flying around 35.000 feet is 
kept at the normal air pressure for 5,000 to 6,000 feet. But emergency oxygen masks 
must be available. And, the crews of non-pressurized aircraft must use oxygen masks 
whenever they are above 14,000 feet.
As an airliner climbs away from the airport, the air pressure inside is gradually 
lowered. While the plane might be climbing 2,000 feet each minute, the pressure changes 
as if in a 500 feet-per-minute climb, a more tolerable pressure for humans. When the 
plane descends, the pressure normally changes at the rate of about 300 feet each minute, 
even though the actual descent is faster.

Mapping highs and lows
Stopped-up eats or aching sinuses tell people about air-pressure changes caused by going 
higher or lower in the atmosphere. Most people's bodies don't tell them about the 
important air-pressure changes associated with weather. Pressure changes too slowly 
from one place to another on the Earth's surface for most people to feel. These 
differences, however, are the ones that cause the winds. They're marked on weather maps 
by Hs and Ls.

The letters denote areas of high and low air pressure. An H marks the center of an 
area with higher pressure than its surroundings. An L marks the center of an area with 
lower air pressure than surrounding areas. High and low pressure are always relative. 
There's no particular pressure number that divides high and low.
In general, low air pressure at the Earth's surface means clouds and precipitation 
while high pressure usually brings clear skies.

Measuring air pressure
One of the results of the flowering of scientific knowledge that came with the end of 
the Middle Ages was the invention of the mercury barometer in 1643 by Evangelista 
Torricelli, one of Galileo's assistants. Mercury barometers used today to make air 
pressure readings are little changed from Torricelli's original.
A mercury barometer (left) is a simple instrument. A tube that's closed at one end is 
filled with mercury and put, open end down, into a container of mercury. A ruler is 
attached next to the tube. Air pressure on the mercury in the container keeps the mercury 
in the tube from flowing out. The greater the air pressure, the higher the mercury will rise 
in the tube. The air's pressure pushes down harder on the mercury in the dish, forcing 
more of it up into the tube. Because there is an inch-ruler next to the mercury tube, 
meteorologists measure air pressure in inches of mercury -instead of pounds per square 
inch. Very high pressure at the surface can push the mercury up approximately 32 inches 
into the tube.
Since a 32-inch tube of mercury is bulky and often inconvenient, aneroid barometers 
are more common than mercury barometers. An aneroid barometer is a flexible metal 
bellows that's been tightly sealed after having some air removed. It might remind you of a 
tiny accordion. Increased outside air pressure squeezes the flexible metal; decreased 
pressure allows it to expand. It can be attached to a pointer or a moving pen to keep a 
pressure record as shown at left.

Millibars and kilopascals
In this chapter, pressure usually will be discussed in pounds per square inch. The sea 
level pressure of 14.7 pounds per square inch, for example, means 14.7 pounds of force is 
pushing against each square inch of any surface exposed to the air. Pressure pushes 
equally in all directions, up, down and sideways.
Meteorologists, however, usually use other measurements. In the United States, 
inches of mercury is the most common measurement used for pressure at the Earth's 
surface. This comes from the mercury barometer. Most of the rest of the world uses a 
metric measurement called the millibar. It is a direct pressure measurement like pounds 
per square inch. In some places these measurements are given in kilopascals, which are 
millibars divided by 10. In the United States upper-atmosphere pressures are always 
measured in millibars and weather reports meant for scientists use millibars for surface 
pressure.

Pressure and altitude
Because air pressure decreases as altitude increases, airplane pilots can determine 
their plane's altitude with a special kind of aneroid barometer called an altimeter. 
Altimeters are more precise than many aneroid barometers and can be adjusted to account 
for weather changes. A change in air pressure of one-tenth of an inch of mercury will 
make an altimeter read 100 feet higher or lower.
Climbing 2,000 feet up a mountain or in an airplane can create a difference in air 
pressure of about two inches of mercury. On the ground, to get that land of pressure 
change you would have to go from the center of a strong high-pressure system to the 
center of a strong low-pressure system. You would be in the middle of quite a storm.

The balance between gravity's pull and pressure keeps vertical air pressure changes 
from causing winds to blow up or down. But, relatively tiny pressure differences between 
places at the same altitude can cause roaring winds.
A pressure change at 1.7 inches of mercury might not sound like much. In fact that's 
the change that occurs on an elevator ride up the 1,707 feet to the top at the Sears Tower 
in Chicago. But, if you traveled across the ocean for about 150 miles and came through 
that same pressure change, you'd be in a hurricane. In fact, the normal air pressure at the 
top of the Sears Tower is what you would find a few feet above the ocean in the center of 
a hurricane with winds above 110 mph.

Starting the winds moving
Winds are the result of the action of various forces, all of which are acting at the 
same time. In order to understand the winds, we have to look at these forces one at a 
time. We have to pretend that the wind begins with one force, then another and so on. 
Just remember, all the forces we talk about are acting together.

The drawings below show how differences in air pressure create one of the forces 
that causes the winds. The top drawing shows two containers of air connected by a pipe. 
This is a push-of-war instead of a tug-of-war. Even though the air in both containers is 
applying a force, the air in the pipe will move in the direction the stronger one is pushing. 
The greater the difference in strength between the two containers, the faster the air will 
go.

Winds are stronger if the high- and low-pressure areas are close together. If the tube 
between the two air containers were longer, as shown in the bottom drawing, the added 
air in the tube would mean the pressure would have more weight to push. Keeping the 
same force, but adding more distance - therefore, more weight - means the air wouldn't be 
pushed as fast.

Wind makers
Three important forces work together to determine how strong the winds will be and 
where they will blow.
Pressure Gradient Force: This goes back to our push-of-war. To forecast winds, 
meteorologists note the size of the pressure difference and the distance between the high- 
and low-pressure areas. This combination is called the Pressure Gradient Force (PGF).
Friction: As wind blows near the surface of the Earth, it rubs against trees, hills, 
buildings and other objects that slow it down. That is the force of friction. There is far 
less friction over water than over land.
Coriolis Effect: Pressure Gradient Force and friction would explain everything about 
winds if the Earth were not rotating. The wind could blow straight from high pressure to 
low pressure and die down when the pressures equalize. But the Earth is spinning, which 
is why winds curve as they blow.

Things that move freely across the Earth – rockets, ocean currents, the wind - that 
might follow a straight path if the Earth wasn't rotating end up following a curved path. 
The Earth is rotating under them.
In the Northern Hemisphere the wind, ocean currents or rockets act as though they're 
being pushed to their right. In the Southern Hemisphere the push is to the left. This 
curving motion is called the Coriolis Effect named after Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis, a 
French scientist who first described it mathematically in 1835. An important point: The 
Coriolis Effect depends on speed. The faster a rocket or the wind is moving, the stronger 
the Coriolis Effect.

Vertical movement of air
Imagine putting in a wood screw. Turn the screwdriver clockwise and the screw goes 
down. Turn counterclockwise, the screw comes up. This will help you remember that in 
the Northern Hemisphere, air goes clockwise and down around high pressure. Air goes 
counterclockwise and up around low pressure.

Sinking air in a high-pressure area is warmed by the increase in pressure. As it warms, 
any water in the air evaporates into vapor. Even more important, the warming keeps 
water vapor from condensing into clouds and precipitation. That makes for generally 
good weather. 

Rising air in low-pressure areas becomes cooler. It condenses water vapor into 
clouds and precipitation - wet weather. Eventually air rising in low-pressure areas comes 
down in high-pressure areas at the surface.

Jet stream winds
How gases react to temperature and pressure, how high pressure pushes air, and the 
three forces on wind are the building blocks of jet streams, a major influence on our 
weather.
Jet streams are relatively narrow bands of high-speed winds in the upper atmosphere. 
Their general direction is west to east   hut they can swoop northward and southward. 
They develop when strong temperature differences cause great pressure differences at 
high altitudes. In general, the twists and turns of jet streams follow the boundaries 
between warm and cold air.
In winter, because temperature contrasts are greater, jet streams tend to blow faster. 
In the Northern Hemisphere they move south as polar air pushes south, shoving the 
warm-cold boundary southward. Polar jet streams cross Canada during the summer and 
slip southward over the United States in the winter. They move back and forth with the 
advance and retreat of cold air. Subtropical jet streams often flow over the southern 
United States in the winter.
Jet streams blow from west to east in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. 
The drawings on Pages 36 and 37 show how in the Northern Hemisphere cold, high-
altitude temperatures in the north and warm, high-altitude temperatures in the south 
create pressure differences that push air around 30,000 feet above the ground from south 
to north - toward the North Pole. Coriolis Effect turns the resulting wind to its right, 
creating west-to-east jet streams.
In the Southern Hemisphere, the high-altitude temperature differences are similar, 
but the cold is in the south, the warm in the north. The resulting pressure differences push 
wind southward, toward the South Pole. But, in the Southern Hemisphere, Coriolis Effect 
turns the wind to its left. Since the wind is heading south, a left turn means it ends up 
blowing from west to east.

Jet streams and jets
Jet streams are extremely important to pilots of high-flying airplanes - and to 
airlines. In fact, the right jet stream winds are money in the bank for an airline. Even on 
the relatively short Chicago to New York flight, catching a 150 mph, eastbound jet 
stream can save 400 to 500 gallons of fuel for a Boeing 727. It works the other way, too. 
A westbound airliner from Europe to Chicago fighting a strong eastbound jet stream 
might have to land early to take on more fuel.
Jet streams account for many of the bumps you feel in a high-flying airliner. As an 
airplane flies through any area where the wind's speed or direction changes rapidly, the 
ride will be bumpy because of wind shear. In recent years the term wind shear has come 
to be associated with a particular kind of wind near the ground called a downburst, which 
has caused several airline accidents. But wind shear is any sudden change in wind speed 
or direction. It can happen near the ground or at 35,000 feet. It can be vertical or 
horizontal. The bigger the change in speed or direction, the greater the turbulence. The 
International Civil Aviation Organization defines a wind-speed change of mote than 10 
mph in a 100-foot distance as strong wind shear. A change of more than 14 mph in 100 
feet is severe wind shear.

Temperate zones
The parts of the Earth from roughly 30 degrees to 50 degrees latitude in both 
hemispheres are known as the temperate zones. Most of the United States except northern 
Alaska and Hawaii is in this zone. While the average temperatures in these regions are 
temperate compared with constant polar cold or tropical heat, anyone who lives in the 
mainland United States knows the weather can be anything but temperate.
War zones might be a better term. These middle latitudes are where polar cold and 
tropical heat battle, creating storms. Storms, which are low-pressure areas, move across 
the land and sea, followed by, high-pressure areas. As the lows and highs pass, winds 
from these clashes can swing from all directions. But the ever-present strong jet streams 
often guide these storms. That is why most storms generally follow a path from west to 
east.
In the Northern Hemisphere winds encounter plenty of resistance. They run into the 
Rockies and other large western mountains and the smaller Appalachians in the eastern 
United States. The large mountain ranges of Europe and Asia also slow the winds. But in 
the Southern Hemisphere only the tip of South America extends far south of 40 degrees 
south latitude. Winds blow mostly over open ocean. This allows the winds to build up to 
higher speeds and kick up huge waves that can circle the globe without hitting land. 
Because of these winds, sailors started calling the region the roaring 40s.

Global wind patterns
Trade winds blow generally from northeast to southwest in the Northern 
Hemisphere. For hundreds of years, sailing ship captains - among them Christopher 
Columbus - sailed far enough south to catch the steady, easterly trade winds that pushed 
them westward to the Caribbean. To return to Europe, they sailed northward close to the 
North American coast until they found the westerly winds that predominate in the 
temperate latitudes.

The Intertropical Convergence Zone, where the trade winds come together - 
converge - shows up on satellite photos as a band of white clouds near the equator. 
Sailors know this zone as the doldrums. Here the winds blow lightly or not at all. As the 
trade winds approach this area, they die out as air warmed by the tropical oceans begins 
rising.
During the Northern Hemisphere summer, as shown on Page 41, the Intertropical 
Convergence Zone creeps northward especially over Asia. The zone moves more directly 
under the sun where it's hotter. In the fall it moves southward to the equator, or, in some 
places, even south of the equator.

Air rising from the Intertropical Convergence Zone's thunderstorms flows northward 
or southward in the upper atmosphere and sinks when it gets about as far north as Florida 
or as far south as Australia. Then it forms huge high-pressure areas at the surface with 
light winds. On land these high-pressure areas help create the Earth's large deserts, such 
as in the southwestern United States and across northern Africa and Saudi Arabia. At sea, 
these high-pressure areas, where air is slowly descending, create calm or light, variable 
winds and mostly clear skies.

Polar winds: Around the poles, the winds are variable, but blow from the east on 
average. As cold air piles up, it creates strong high pressure at the surface.

As cold air flows away from the North and South Poles, it warms slightly, as it reaches 
about 60 degrees latitude, where the ocean is a little warmer. Warming causes the air to 
rise, which creates low-pressure areas. Meteorologists call these semi-permanent lows, 
since they are in the same places most of the time, but not always. Air flowing away from 
both the North and South Poles into these low-pressure areas causes easterly winds 
around the polar regions in both hemispheres.

The clear skies of the high-pressure areas and cloudy skies of the lows are important 
global weather makers. The pattern of winds around the semi-permanent areas of high 
and low pressure also makes west winds dominate at the surface in the temperate zones. 
The flow of the wind around these big highs and lows is a weather predictor.
The drawings on the next page show how these semi-permanent pressure areas and 
the winds around them change from January to July.
As you look at the drawings you'll see that low-pressure areas over the oceans near 
the poles grow in the winter, shrink in the summer. The high-pressure areas over tropical 
oceans, in contrast, grow in summer and shrink in winter.
Low-pressure areas in a particular latitude form over the warmer parts of the globe. 
In winter, oceans near the poles are warmer than the land. Air over the warm water is 
warmed more than air over land and begins rising, creating low pressure - and stormy 
weather Areas such as the Aleutian Low spawn winter storms. In summer, as the land 
warms up, the contrast between land and ocean temperatures decreases and the low-
pressure areas weaken. 
High-pressure areas in a particular latitude form where the surface is cooler. In the 
summer, the contrast between the hot, tropical land and the cooler oceans is greater than 
in winter. This is why the high-pressure areas over tropical oceans grow in the summer.


Local winds
While global-scale winds, such as the trades, determine the weather over large areas, 
smaller winds create local weather.

Sea breezes: One of the most common local winds is a sea breeze along the ocean or 
near large lakes. During the day the land heats up more than the water. Warm air rises 
over the land and cooler air flows in from the water to replace it. If the water is warm 
enough, such as off the coast of Florida, a land breeze can begin at night as the land 
cools.

Mountain winds: Mountains also create their own winds. During the day the sun can 
heat mountain slopes, especially bare rock. The warmed air above rises and more air 
flows upward from valleys to replace it. This creates a wind blowing up the mountain 
during the afternoon. As the mountain slopes cool at night, cold air, which is heavier than 
warm air, begins flowing down into the valleys.

Winds, whether they're the jet streams racing overhead, the gales in the roaring 40s or the 
first warm breezes of spring, move masses of air around the Earth. The clash of these 
moving air masses creates the storms that dominate our ever-changing weather.
