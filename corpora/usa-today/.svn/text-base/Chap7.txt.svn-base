Meteorologists like to tell about the forecaster who gets a call from an irate man: 
Hey, buddy, how about coming over and shoveling out the six inches of partly cloudy in 
my driveway.
Anyone who has done much forecasting of winter storms is almost sure to have 
predicted partly cloudy skies for the following day, only to wake up the next morning to 
find a half-foot of snow on the ground, That same forecaster at one time or another has 
probably called for a big snowstorm only to wake up to partly cloudy skies.
Such busted forecasts are an annoyance to the person whose car is covered by six 
inches of 'partly cloudy' or to children who dreamed of a school snow day only to wake 
and find the ground bare and school open. But, they are more than an annoyance.
Our schedules today don't allow for weather delays. An unforecast snowstorm traps 
travelers and forces thousands of people to make last minute changes. A forecast storm 
that fizzles closes schools and businesses unnecessarily and costs highway departments 
thousands of dollars in pay for crews that may have been called in at overtime rates.
As forecasters move into the era of improved technology and computers, they are 
sure their winter storm predictions will improve. Scientists already are using new ways of 
looking at the weather to untangle the complications of snow and ice storms.
Big snowstorms are almost always a product of an extratropical cyclone. These 
storms have numerous ways of making forecasters look bad.
When an extratropical cyclone is on the move in winter, forecasters' problems begin 
with determining the storm's exact track and timing. The path is vital to the forecast 
because rain is likely on the storm's warmer southern and eastern sides, while snow is 
probable on the northern and western sides. Often a mixture of rain, freezing rain, sleet 
and snow will fall somewhere in the middle. While one city is being buried in snow, 
another an hour away may be having rain.
A successful winter storm forecast should say what kind of precipitation - rain, 
freezing rain, or snow - will fall, when it will start, how long it will last, how hard it will 
be, and exactly where it will fall. But storms' small-scale antics sometimes wreck such 
forecasts.
Storms can slow down or speed up. And even if the forecaster is right on the money 
with the storm's track and timing, the prediction can still go wrong. As researchers look at 
winter storms in more detail, using technology such as Doppler radar that detects wind 
speed and direction and even the air's up and down movements, they're finding that the 
details of a winter storm are incredibly complicated.
For three years, from 1988 through 1990, scientists closely examined winter storms 
in a 190-mile circle centered on Champaign, Ill. They found that small-scale changes 
from rain to snow to ice and back were happening in as little as 30 minutes.
If forecasters knew when such sudden changes were coming, they could keep their 
forecasts updated. But they don't always know what causes the changes, which means 
they can't predict them.
Mohan K Ramamurthy of the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, says the 
Illinois project has helped lead to new ideas about small-scale disturbances embedded in 
storms. But, he says, it's still not a science that's been perfected. In some cases an event 
can be like a big footprint you see on the ground and just don't know where it came from.

Winter's wide variety
In the three years of the Illinois study, 26 storms moved across the region. Their 
variety illustrates the range of Midwestern winter weather. Many of these storms looked 
similar in the early stages. In one, precipitation fell for only 30 minutes; in another, for 28 
hours. One storm spawned an extremely damaging tornado. In some storms thunder and 
lightning accompanied heavy snow. Some brought heavy snow to Champaign; others, 
temperatures in the 50s with rain. One storm caused extensive floods east of the research 
area in Kentucky and West Virginia. While forecasters could distinguish the 30-minute 
snowfall from the 28-hour snowstorm ahead of time, most storms produced at least a few 
surprises.
The worst storm hit Champaign on Valentine's Day 1990. Freezing rain coated the 
area with an inch and a half of ice that did more than 59 million in damage and left the 
Champaign area without power for a week. To the north, 9 inches of snow fell on 
Chicago while rain was falling on southern Illinois.
Ramamurthy says that storm illustrates just one of the practical pitfalls of studying 
winter storms. After two hours of freezing rain, all our instruments lost power. We 
couldn't launch (weather) balloons. We couldn't turn on the radar. With power out for 
five days, the temperature inside his house fell to 35 F. Weather study took second place. 
Researchers were busy trying to keep their water pipes from freezing.

The giant storms
A major United States winter storm often begins with a storm from the Pacific Ocean 
hitting the West Coast. Here the dividing line between rain and snow depends mostly on 
elevation because the ocean air is mild. The same storm will drench San Francisco with 
rain, while burying higher parts of the Sierra Nevada, such as Donner Pass, under 10 or 
15 feet of snow. Storms normally have little moisture left after they cross the Sierra into 
the Rockies, but they often cover the Rockies with a few feet of dry, powdery snow.
After weakening in the mountains, storms normally begin to strengthen on the Plains 
east of the Rockies. A storm can follow a variety of paths as it moves eastward. But no 
matter which path it follows, the storm begins drawing in warm, humid air from the Gulf 
of Mexico and cold, dry air from Canada as it crosses the Plains and heads east. The 
contrasting air masses supply both the energy and moisture needed for blizzards.
From the Midwest, storms follow various tracks. Some move into Canada across the 
Great Lakes with little effect on the Southeast. Sometimes a storm will seemingly die 
west of the Appalachians, but the storm's cold air and counterclockwise motion in the 
upper atmosphere will move across the mountains to stir up a secondary storm along the 
Atlantic Coast. These secondary storms account for some of the heaviest snowfalls in the 
East. Storms moving up the East Coast from the Gulf of Mexico also can explode into 
major snowstorms in the mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states.

The beauty of snow flakes
When you're in no hurry to travel and a power failure isn't turning your home into a 
huge, walk-in freezer, you can enjoy the beauty of a big storm's snow and ice.
Wilson A. Bentley, who spent almost 50 years photographing snow crystals, helped 
create the picture most of us have of snowflakes. When children fold paper and cut out 
six-sided snowflakes they are creating figures much like those Bentley photographed. 
Artists and designers are still using Bentley's photographs as patterns. Such snowflakes 
are really snow crystals. Flakes are collections of crystals.
Like his parents before him, Bentley spent his life as a farmer in Vermont. He began 
observing snow in 1880, when he was 15 years old, with a microscope that his mother 
gave him for Christmas. After putting a few snow crystals on a slide and looking at them 
through the microscope, Bentley was hooked for life. The first three winters he sketched 
what he saw. Then he began a lifetime of photographing the shapes of snow.
Bentley recorded a few observations of the conditions under which various kinds of 
crystals fell, but his true love was the beauty of the crystals themselves. The book "Snow 
Crystals," which he published in 1931 with W J. Humphreys, contains more than 2,300 
photos of snow crystals along with other photos of frost patterns. Most of the snow 
crystals are intricate, six-sided plates or stars.
If you spend enough time closely examining snow crystals, you'll find plenty of the 
beautiful, symmetrical crystals like the ones in Bentley's book. But such crystals are far 
from the most common. The most widespread are small and irregular with no easily 
identifiable form.
Scientists as far back as Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) had wondered about the 
hexagonal form of snow crystals. Today's scientists know that snow crystal shapes reflect 
the hexagonal organization that water molecules assume when they freeze. This 
organization is dictated by the way electrical attractions bond water molecules.
The many forms snow crystals take are partly explained by the number of water 
molecules involved - in the range of 10 followed by 18 zeroes. Cloud physicist Charles 
Knight says there's no way to calculate the number of shapes that crystals can take when 
you consider the number of molecules involved and the different ways they can arrange 
themselves in three dimensions using the basic hexagonal pattern.
Like Bentley, Ukichiro Nakaya, who worked at Hokkaido University in Japan from 
1930 until his death in 1962, photographed snow crystals. As a scientist he was interested 
in discovering which conditions led to what kinds of crystals. Over several years Nakaya 
spent hours in storms catching snow crystals, making detailed notes of the weather 
conditions. He also created snow crystals in the laboratory precisely controlling the tem-
perature.
Nakaya's key discovery was that the temperature largely determines whether a 
crystal will grow into a flat, plate-like form or into a long, column-like or prism-like 
form.
Many natural crystals are combinations of the two because they spend time in areas 
with different temperatures as they're carried higher in updrafts or as they fall toward the 
ground.

Are all snow crystals different?
Just about everyone has heard that no two snowflakes are ever alike. The closer you look 
at that statement, says Knight, the less it means. To begin with, no two crystals ever will 
be alike if alike means every molecule of one crystal is in exactly the same place as every 
molecule of another. Even a single crystal isn't the same from second to second because 
some water molecules constantly are breaking free of the ice to become vapor; while 
other molecules are joining the ice.
Most people think of alike as meaning that the crystals have to look the same. By this 
looser standard, the statement that no two crystals are alike isn't true, Knight says. Many 
tiny snow crystals are simple, hexagonal plates with no obvious difference in shape.
Even more complicated crystals can be alike, as Knight's wife, Nancy; also a cloud 
physicist, discovered in 1989. She photographed twin snow crystals snared by a research 
aircraft on a cloud-study flight about 20,000 feet over Wausau, Wis. The crystals were 
thick, hollow columns 250 micrometers long and 170 micrometers wide. A human hair is 
about 100 micrometers in diameter.
These twin crystals, however, weren't the elaborate, six-sided figures most people 
think of as typical snow crystals. Considering how many water molecules go into such 
crystals and how many ways these molecules can arrange themselves, the odds are 
against anyone finding two star-like crystals that look the same. So while the no two 
snow crystals are alike isn't literally true, Knight says, it's a nice way of saying snow 
crystals can be very complex.

Other kinds of ice
Snow makes up only seven of the 10 kinds of frozen precipitation in the International 
snow classification system. The others are graupel (pronounced GROU-pel), ice pellets 
and hail.
When we start naming the different kinds of ice, confusion begins. Scientists don't 
always agree on the names. Here we'll talk about snow, graupel, ice pellets and hail as the 
kinds of ice that fall from the sky. Each is described in the way commonly used by most 
American scientists. But the official guide for United States weather observers has 
different descriptions. And, neither set of definitions uses the common word "sleet," 
which is defined differently in various parts of the English-speaking world. In the United 
States, sleet refers to frozen raindrops, or ice pellets.
To understand why ice takes so many forms, start with this fact: Water can cool 
below 32 F - often called the freezing point of water - without ice crystals forming. 
Supercooled drops of water range in size from tiny cloud droplets to drizzle to raindrop 
size. These drops turn into ice when they come in contact with an ice nucleus or 
something solid. Supercooled raindrops leave a glaze of ice on sidewalks, roads, trees, 
power lines, your car's windshield and your front steps. This is called freezing rain. 
Smaller supercooled drops are freezing drizzle.
Why don't the drops freeze when they cool below 32 F? Charles Knight puts it this 
way: Water below freezing wants to be ice. It just has to learn how. Super-cooled water 
learns how to become ice by coming in contact with ice crystals or ice nuclei. An 
individual cloud drop or raindrop isn't likely to freeze until it meets an ice nucleus or ice 
that's already formed. When supercooled rain or drizzle is falling, a few ice crystals or ice 
nuclei are likely to be mixed in or on the surface being hit. These crystals are the seeds 
that turn the supercooled water into a sheet of ice.

If the drops are tiny, they freeze instantly on contact, creating tiny balls of ice with 
air between them. This is rime. The trapped air gives rime a milky white appearance. 
When larger supercooled drops hit, they spread out before freezing, creating smooth ice 
or "glaze." Small drops also can create glaze if the temperature is warm enough to slow 
their freezing. Rime and glaze can be mixed together.
Glaze from freezing rain often is destructive. Since the water spreads out to freeze, 
the ice is smooth. Cars skid on roads and people fall on sidewalks. The ice's weight pulls 
down power lines and tree limbs. Since tiny drops freeze on contact to make rime, they 
keep their shape; the ice isn't slick. Clouds of supercooled droplets create icy, mountain 
wonderlands when they deposit thick coats of rime on trees and buildings.

The struggle against ice and snow
For centuries people who lived in places covered by winter snow looked forward to 
the season's first big snowstorm. Horse-drawn sleds zipped along roads that wagons 
plodded over in the summer - or couldn't manage at all when rain turned roads into bogs.
With the advent of railroads, snow and ice presented a new kind of travel barrier in 
the middle of the 19th century. Deep snow could block the rails. Usually a plow blade 
mounted on a locomotive, maybe with another locomotive or two pushing, could clear 
the rails. Keeping the tracks open also meant hiring hundreds of workers to shovel snow 
from around switches or other places where plows didn't do the job.
At times, however; blizzards on the Plains and snow in mountains overwhelmed simple 
plows and crews of shovelers. A dozen locomotives working together sometimes were 
unable to push a plow through the snow blocking mountain railroads. The big 
breakthrough in railroad snow clearing came with the development of rotary plows in the 
mid-1880s. The rotor, often 10 to 12 feet high, consisted of blades that hurled snow off to 
the side. Similar plows still are used to cut through deep snow both on railroads and 
highways.
Until the mid-1950s most public works departments fought ice by spreading sand or 
cinders on roads to improve traction. Plows pushed the snow away, and drivers often 
used tire chains to drive on snowy streets. By the 1960s, however; a dry pavement snow 
policy was the rule in many places, especially in the East. Drivers wanted snow removed 
completely and quickly without leaving icy roads behind. Snow tires were fine. Tire 
chains were a bother. Citizens voted out politicians who couldn't get ice and snow 
quickly removed.
Salt was the answer. It's relatively cheap, it melts ice unless the temperature is 
extremely low, and it's easy to spread on roads. Its downside wasn't immediately evident.
But by the 1970s the damage from salt was becoming obvious. Not only were cars 
and trucks rusting out, corrosion was destroying bridges and streets. People saw the 
environmental damage signaled by dying trees along roads. Despite the costs of repairing 
and rebuilding bridges and roads, a return to natural snow and ice removal  - the spring 
thaw - was unlikely.
Today in the United States, keeping roads and highways clear of ice and snow costs 
an estimated $2 billion a year. In addition, various studies say damage, mostly from the 
salt used to melt ice, costs individuals and governments between $800 million and $2.5 
billion a year. Much of this is corrosion damage to roads, bridges and vehicles. But it also 
includes environmental problems such as salt damage to trees, streams and even wells, 
which can't be used when underground water becomes too salty to drink.
John Qualls, the California Department of Transportation region manager 
responsible for Interstate 80 across Donner Pass, sums up the salt dilemma: I am 
concerned about salt use. I don't like to see vehicles rusting, I don't like to see trees dying, 
and I don't like to see streams polluted. But neither do I like to see the broken and twisted 
bodies of accident victims, or massive traffic tie-ups due to vehicles' inability to traverse 
the highway At this time, considering the level of service the public demands and the 
budgetary constraints we work under; we have no choice but to judiciously use salt or 
some other effective de-icer to keep our highways open.
Judicious use of salt is being made easier by technological improvements and 
sensible salting educational campaigns. The idea is to use no more salt than needed to 
keep a road from turning dangerously slick. Since the 1970s, salt spreaders have been 
changed to key the application rate to the salt truck's speed. Old spreaders ran at the same 
speed whether the truck was going 40 mph, 10 mph or was stopped. Calcium chloride is 
sometimes mixed with salt. And while it is corrosive, too, calcium chloride makes the salt 
more effective, cutting down the amount needed.
Improvements both in vehicles and tires also have helped. Today's cars and trucks 
don't rust out as easily as those of a decade or two ago. Tire companies have developed 
rubber that has a better grip on ice or wet pavement. Some states allow winter use of 
metal tire studs that make skidding more unlikely.
Bridges and roads are being designed to withstand corrosion. Since the big problems arise 
from corrosion of the reinforcing bars inside concrete, bars are being coated with epoxy. 
Salt also can be kept away from the reinforcing bars by adding something that blocks 
water, such as a wax, in the concrete between the road surface and the bars.


New ice fighters
Other materials melt ice or keep it from bonding to roads, but all are more expensive 
than salt and many pose environmental problems of their own. Many airports and some 
highway maintenance departments use the liquid ethylene glycol, but it's considered a 
hazard to fish and other aquatic life, and it is expensive.
Calcium magnesium acetate (CMA) is being used in environmentally sensitive areas 
because it doesn't seem to harm the environment and is far less corrosive than salt. But it 
costs around $650 a ton compared to $25 to $50 a ton for ordinary rock salt. Some states 
require its use on new bridges and in areas that are sensitive to environmental damage. 
The calcium and magnesium come from dolomitic lime, a common material. The acetate, 
which is what makes CMA so expensive, is made from natural gas. Scientists are looking 
for ways to cut CMA's price by producing acetate at a lower cost. Making it by 
fermentation from plant material, such as corn, might be the answer.
Researchers have looked into materials that could be mixed into the pavement of 
new roads to keep ice from sticking. Others are looking for new ways, not involving 
chemicals, to break ice loose from roads. None has shown much promise. Research that 
does show promise is the development of more efficient plows, which could cut the cost 
of snow removal.
Finally, keeping so much snow from piling up on the road can he more effective than 
many highway engineers suspect, says Ronald Tabler, who specializes in snow, dust and 
wind engineering. Usually snow is ignored in the design of highways and other facilities, 
he says. The added expense is thought not to be worthwhile by engineers in warm offices 
miles from the project. If you're not out there in the blowing snow, it doesn't seem to be 
as important a factor as cost.
Tabler explains that large, well-designed snow fences greatly reduce the amount of 
snow drifting onto highways. We can say, in general, it costs about 100 times more to 
plow snow than to store it with fences. Studies of road-clearing costs and accidents in 
Wyoming on Interstate 80 between Laramie and Walcott Junction, show that the stretch's 
$1.9 million worth of fences have saved at least that much in property damage from 
accidents in 15 years.
 	Wyoming believes in highway snow fences. There's probably more wood in snow 
fences in Wyoming than there is wood in houses, Tabler jokes. Montana and snowy parts 
of Arizona also use 12-foot-high snow fences. Higher fences are required in the West 
where the wind generally blows harder. In the East, eight-foot fences have done well in 
tests in the Buffalo, N.Y. area and are likely to become more common.

The best hope for snow control
In 1987 the U.S. Congress established the Strategic Highway Research Program 
under the National Research Council. David Minsk of the council says improvements in 
weather forecasting and automated systems that keep track of what's happening to roads 
offer the best hope for cutting the use of salt. Sensors and computer hookups that feed up-
to-the-minute road and weather information to maintenance supervisors are being set up 
to supply the needed data.
This information is invaluable in determining when they should take some action, 
Minsk says. They have the knowledge to make the proper decisions and this offers the 
biggest potential of cost savings. They can avoid the useless call-up of crews; false 
alarms can be extremely costly. On the other hand, if they try to save money and not call 
the crews out in time, then there are extra costs in removing the snow and ice.
While such systems tell a highway superintendent what's going on now, good 
forecasts of what's going to happen in the next hour or two also are vital. If salt or other 
chemicals can be spread just as freezing rain or snow begins, the ice won't freeze on the 
road and less salt will be needed. Knowing whether snow is likely to end in the next half 
hour, or continue for another six, can help highway managers use resources effectively.
Improved forecasts of winter storms are among the goals of the National Weather 
Service's modernization. By the year 2000, the entire United States should be observed 
by the kinds of instruments only a handful of researchers were using in the 1980s and 
1990s. Today, these new observational tools are helping researchers develop new 
forecasting techniques. By the turn of the century, all weather offices should be using the 
new instruments and techniques for day-to-day predictions.
The researchers' expectation is that by then winter storm forecasts will be much more 
accurate than they are now no matter whether you're a child looking forward to a snow 
day, a pilot planning a fight into wintry clouds, a maintenance supervisor for a mountain 
highway, or just someone who doesn't want to shovel off six inches of 'partly cloudy'.
