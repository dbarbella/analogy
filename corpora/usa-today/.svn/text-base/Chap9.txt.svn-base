Hurricanes are the only natural disasters with their own names. Hugo, Camille, 
Agnes, Hazel, Gilbert - each evokes its particular image of disaster. Hurricanes are the 
same in vital ways; yet, like people, each has its own personality.
Names seem appropriate because we come to know hurricanes before they strike, 
unlike earthquakes, which hit without warning, or tornadoes, which quickly come and go 
with at best a few minutes warning.
Hurricanes are special. You can make a good argument that they are the Earth's most 
awesome storms.
Winds in the strongest tornadoes can top 300 mph, while hurricane winds above 150 
mph are rare. But a tornado is much more concentrated than even the smallest hurricane. 
A mile-wide tornado is huge, a 100-mile-wide hurricane is small. Few tornadoes last 
even an hour, and a damage path of 100 miles goes into the record books.
Hurricanes easily can last more than a week and can devastate islands around the 
Caribbean days before slamming into the United States.
Extratropical cyclones, which we examined in Chapter 4, are larger than hurricanes 
and even a weak one will affect mote people than most hurricanes. But extratropical 
cyclones rarely produce hurricane force winds - 74 mph or more.
A large hurricane stirs up more than a million cubic miles of the atmosphere every 
second. Hurricane winds can lack up 50-foot or higher waves in the open ocean. When a 
storm hits land, it brings a mound of water that can rise to a peak height of more than 20 
feet near the eye and flood 100 miles of coast with 10 feet of water. A typical hurricane 
dumps six to 12 inches of rain when it comes ashore - some bring much more and have 
caused some of our worst floods.
Hurricanes even affect the very depths of the ocean. In 1975 instruments dropped 
from research airplanes in the Gulf of Mexico showed that Hurricane Eloise disturbed the 
ocean hundreds of feet down and created underwater waves that persisted for weeks.

Figuring out the big picture
We're so used to seeing satellite photos of hurricanes, it's difficult to imagine a time 
when people didn't understand that such storms are huge masses of wind circling around 
a center The center is the eye we see so clearly on most satellite photos of full-blown 
hurricanes.
Well into the 19th century a clear distinction wasn't always made between tropical 
cyclones and extratropical cyclones. Some summer and fall storms from the tropics, 
however; were known to be especially fierce. While a few sailors and scientists had 
suggested that storms were huge whirlwinds, the general view was that storms were 
masses of air moving straight across the Earth. Winds that died and then blew from 
another direction were considered to be dose, but separate storms. Today we know the 
calm is the eye of a hurricane.
William Redfield, a Connecticut saddle and harness maker - and a self-taught 
scientist - is credited with taking a key early step toward today's understanding of 
hurricanes. While traveling around Connecticut by foot - he couldn't afford a horse - after 
a strong hurricane that hit in September 1821, he noticed trees and corn in some areas 
were blown down pointing toward the northwest, while those only a few miles away were 
pointing to the southeast.
He gathered more information about the storm from other places along the East 
Coast and concluded in an article in the American Journal of Science in 1831 that: This 
storm was exhibited in the form of a great whirlwind. Redfield's detailed observations 
and logical presentation convinced others in the United States and elsewhere that he was 
on the right track. Following his lead, they began the work of understanding hurricanes 
that continues today.

When and how hurricanes begin
In terms of their potential for destruction, hurricanes and their cousins - typhoons 
and Indian Ocean cyclones - are the world's most violent storms. Yet, these most furious 
of storms are born in the most placid of climates - the tropics.
The tropics supply the key ingredients needed fur tropical cyclones: wide expanses 
of warm ocean water; air that's both warm and humid; normally weak upper-air winds 
blowing from the same direction as winds near the surface.
In the big picture of how the Earth keeps its heat budget balanced, hurricanes are one 
of the ways the atmosphere moves excess heat from the tropics to the middle latitudes.
We can understand hurricanes as huge machines, heat engines, that convert the 
warmth of the tropical oceans and atmosphere into wind and waves. We can be thankful 
that hurricanes aren't very efficient machines. Even the strongest hurricane converts only 
a small amount - around three percent - of its available energy into wind and waves.

We can also be thankful that only a small number of the disturbances with the 
potential to spawn hurricanes actually grow into storms. One study of satellite photos 
found that of the 608 weather systems that moved over the tropical Atlantic during a six-
year period, only 50 developed into tropical storms with 39 mph or stronger winds.

Earliest tracks of hurricanes
Tropical storms that grow into U.S. hurricanes can begin far out in the Atlantic 
Ocean, in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Caribbean Sea or relatively close to shore off the 
Atlantic Coast. A large number of the strongest hurricanes form far out in the Atlantic. 
These are often called Cape Verde hurricanes, after the islands near the coast of West 
Africa where they first begin. These can take more than a week to cross the Atlantic. If 
conditions are favorable, they grow into monster storms during that trip.
The average Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone moves from east to west in the 
tropical trade winds. Many storms turn toward the north, sometimes far out in the 
Atlantic, sometimes farther west. After turning toward the northwest or west, storms tend 
to curve to the northeast. Where a storm begins turning toward the northwest or north 
determines whether it hits the United States or stays over the ocean until it dies.
As storms move north, the steering currents usually become faster because winds at 
all levels of the atmosphere tend to be faster in the mid-latitudes than in the tropics. 
Storms moving northeast along the East Coast usually speed up when they're about as far 
north as Cape Hatteras, N.C. This speedup makes getting warnings out in time difficult.

The fast-moving Hurricane of '38
Such a fast-moving storm killed at least 600 people in New England in 1938, making 
it America's fourth deadliest storm this century.
At 7 a.m. the morning of Sept. 21, 1938, the hurricane's eye was about 100 miles east 
of Cape Hatteras, N.C. By 2 p.m. it was crossing Long Island, N.Y, about 350 miles 
farther along, and by 8 that night the storm's center passed Burlington, Vt., another 275 
miles. At times the storm was moving forward at a speed of 70 mph.
Quickly rising water – the storm surge - destroyed houses along the Long Island, 
Rhode Island and Connecticut shorelines and the hurricane's winds toppled trees across 
New England. Seventeen inches of rain fell on an area that had been soaked by rain for 
days, causing record-breaking floods. The hurricane set a record for damage that stood 
until Hurricane Carol in 1954.
Such fast moving storms lead forecasters to issue warnings when a hurricane is still 
hundreds of miles away from land. For instance, as Hurricane Bob moved up the Atlantic 
Coast in August 1991, the U.S. Weather Service issued hurricane warnings for Long 
Island and parts of New England when the storm was still about 400 miles away off Cape 
Hatteras, but only around 22 hours from hitting the warned areas.

Slow moving loop-the-loop hurricanes
	Slow-moving storms also cause forecasting problems. When the steering currents 
become weak, a storm seems to take on a mind of its own. If you look at maps of 
hurricane tracks, you'll see that storms sometimes follow loop-the-loop paths.
At the end of August 1985, Hurricane Elena moved into the Gulf of Mexico and 
headed toward the Florida Panhandle, where beachfront communities were evacuated. 
Then it turned east, heading toward the heavily populated Tampa Bay area of Florida, 
where thousands were evacuated as people in the Panhandle were heading hack home. 
Then Elena did a loop and headed back toward the Panhandle.

People along the Panhandle beaches, as well as in Alabama, Mississippi and 
Louisiana were evacuated again. Elena eventually came ashore on the Mississippi-
Louisiana border, causing about $1.4 billion in damage.

Storm surge: Hurricanes' big killer
Hurricanes are usually described in terms of their wind speeds, but flooding caused 
by the high water a storm brings kills many more people than wind. Flooding also is 
responsible for much of the damage, especially within a few hundred yards of the 
shoreline. Boats ripped from their moorings, utility poles, parts of destroyed buildings 
and other debris crashing in the waves atop hurricane surge often destroy buildings that 
stood up to the wind.
Even without the weight of debris, water is a powerfully destructive force. A cubic 
foot of sea water weighs 64 pounds.

Water does more than batter; it scours away the sand of beaches and dunes. High 
water and pounding waves carry away the sand under sea walls, buildings and roads. As 
the water begins rising in advance of the storm - sometimes hours in advance - it erodes 
the beach and then the dunes or undercuts buildings behind the beach.
When Hurricane Eloise hit the Florida Panhandle in September 1975, it carried away 
an average of 45 cubic yards of sand for each yard of beachfront along about nine miles 
of the coast.
The worst hurricane storm surge recorded in the United States came ashore with 
Hurricane Camille on Aug.17, 1969, at Pass Christian, Miss., where the water rose 24 
feet above normal. While the highest storm surge was concentrated to the right of the eye, 
Camille pushed the Gulf of Mexico at least three feet higher than normal as far as 125 
miles to the east of Pass Christian and 31 miles to the west.
Devastation was concentrated along 60 miles of coast in Alabama and Louisiana as 
well as Mississippi. A damage survey found that more than 5,500 homes had been 
destroyed and another 12,500 had major damage. Some 700 businesses were destroyed or 
left with major damage. After slamming into the Gulf Coast, Camille moved inland to 
Kentucky and then headed back to the east over West Virginia and Virginia where its rain 
brought devastating floods. About half of the 256 people killed by Camille died in the 
floods away from the coast.
Storm surge isn't a killer only along beaches facing the ocean; water is also pushed 
into bays and rivers. As the surge of water squeezes up a narrowing bay or river, it rises 
even higher. When Hurricane Carla hit the Texas Coast between Corpus Christi and 
Galveston in September 1961, the surge pushed water as high as 13 feet above normal on 
the coast, but more than 19 feet above normal 20 miles inland in Lavaca and Galveston 
Bays.
At the National Meteorological Center in Washington, D.C., a computer model 
called SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes) calculates how much 
storm surge a hurricane will cause at any place along a coast. The amount of surge 
depends on a storm's strength, the path it's following and the contours of the ocean and 
bay bottoms as well as the land that will be flooded.
National Weather Service scientists have divided the Gulf and Atlantic coasts into 32 
basins, centered on geographic features, such as Galveston Bay or the southwest coast of 
Florida. For each basin, the local geography, including the shape of the ocean bottom as 
far as 75 miles out to sea, is fed into the computer model. Then simulations are run for 
each basin showing the probable paths of hundreds (in some cases more than 1,000) of 
possible hurricanes of different strengths. Each hurricane simulation requires from half a 
billion to a billion calculations.
The result is a map for each basin showing flood areas for each storm. Emergency 
management officials use these maps to make evacuation and shelter plans. In some 
cases, important escape-route roads have been raised onto embankments after the models 
showed these roads would flood before evacuation was complete.

Can technology outpace growth?
Hurricanes have become national spectacles in the United States. Through constantly 
updated television and radio reports, even people on the Plains, in the Rockies and on the 
West Coast, who'll never experience a hurricane at home, are caught up in the drama of 
what a storm will do.
When a hurricane threatens the United States, television takes us directly to 
forecasters at the Weather Service's National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla. Still 
satellite photos - shown in rapid sequence - make the hurricane seem almost like a living 
thing as we follow its advance toward land.
Today's forecasts combined with instant communication of warnings, better evacuation 
techniques and publicity about storm dangers are saving lives. The dollar cost of 
hurricane damage continues to rise. But the death toll has steadily decreased in the United 
States in this century.
Still, those who know hurricanes are worried - mainly because of the great 
population growth in the danger zone along the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of 
Mexico.
Anyone who has been caught in a traffic jam on the way home from the beach can 
understand why the experts worry about a hurricane someday killing hundreds who are 
trying to flee. Many of the most populated beaches from Texas to Maine are on the 295 
barrier islands that line the coast.
A barrier island is an especially dangerous place in a hurricane because it absorbs a 
storm's worst blows. Hurricane forecasters and emergency management officials have 
nightmares about evacuating people from barrier islands across narrow bridges or on 
overburdened ferries as the wind grows stronger; downpours are reducing visibility and 
motorists are starting to panic.
Major hurricanes, defined as those in Categories 3, 4 or 5 on the Saffir-Simpson 
Damage-Potential Scale, cause the nightmares. These are the storms that have winds of 
111 mph or more and can raise storm surges of nine feet or higher From 1949 through 
1990 a total of 126 tropical storms or hurricanes hit the United States. Based on 1990 
dollars, these storms did about $74 billion in damage. Only 25 of these storms were 
Category 3 or stronger. Yet, these 25 storms accounted for mote than $56 billion of the 
$74 billion in damage.
Since major storms are rare for any particular part of the coast, it's easy to forget 
what they can do to the site of your dream home. Not every place forgets. As shown in 
Chapter 1, the 1900 hurricane that killed more than 6,000 people in Galveston, Texas is 
still much a part of local lore. In 1900 some people called Galveston the New York of the 
South. History doesn't forget a storm that destroys such an important place.
But sometimes, new coastline residents don't know about their neighborhood's 
hurricane history.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, now-retired Hurricane Center Director Neil Frank 
traveled to hurricane-threatened areas with one message: storm preparedness. People in 
many places told him they didn't have a hurricane problem; a reef offshore or the curve of 
the coastline protected their beaches. South Carolina's Sea Islands, where golf courses 
and luxury houses and hotels were replacing the fields and tiny homes of farmers and 
fishermen, was such a place.
Frank says he asked an official on one of the islands if they could evacuate and he 
said they don't see any reason to evacuate. And I said, if I told you 2,000 people died out 
there in 1893 when the islands went under water would you change your mind? His face 
went white and he said, I never heard of that. The August 1893 hurricane, which seems to 
have been roughly the same strength as 1989's Hugo, hit between Charleston, S.C., and 
Savannah, Ga. At the time most of those living on the more remote islands were former 
slaves or their children and grandchildren. Estimates of the death toll range as high as 
3,000.
Joel Chandler Harris, collector of the Uncle Remus stories, described the horror in 
two 1894 magazine articles: The islands, he wrote, were exposed to the full fury of the 
tempest. And the winds fell about them as if trying to tear the earth asunder, and the rains 
beat upon them as if to wash them away, and the tide rose and swept over them twelve 
feet above high water mark. Pitiable as the story is, it may be condensed into a few 
words: near three thousand people drowned, between twenty and thirty thousand human 
beings without means of subsistence, their homes destroyed, their little crops ruined, and 
their boats blown away.
In 1893 the Weather Bureau had sent out alerts that a tropical storm was heading 
toward the Southeast Coast. But forecasters had no way to estimate where and when it 
would hit. In those days before radio, no one could warn people living on remote islands. 
And even if they had been warned, those in danger had no way to escape and nowhere to 
go.

Getting out the warning today
While issuing warnings is easier today, the decisions are much more complicated. 
Hurricane warnings cause people to spend a great deal of money preparing for a storm. 
The average hurricane warning for about 300 miles of Gulf of Mexico Coast costs about 
$50 million for boarding up homes and closing down businesses and manufacturing 
plants.
Imagine that a strong hurricane is moving up the East Coast and computer models 
are hinting, but only hinting, that it could turn inland over Delaware Bay and southern 
New Jersey, pushing a storm surge as much as 11 feet deep into Atlantic City, N.J. If a 
warning is issued, the Atlantic City casinos would close as evacuations begun. If the 
forecast is correct, hundreds of lives could be saved. If it's wrong, Atlantic City would 
have a windy, rainy day that endangers no one. In either case, the casinos would lose a 
day's business - around $8.8 million.
Forecasters want to avoid issuing hurricane warnings for too wide an area, not only 
because of the cost but because they fear warnings that turn out to be unnecessary will 
make residents less likely to heed the next warning. Like all other kinds of forecasts, 
hurricane predictions lose accuracy with time. A forecast of where a storm will be in the 
next 24 hours is much more accurate than one for where it will be in 48 hours.
By waiting as long as possible to issue a warning, a forecaster is less likely to warn 
areas that won't be hit. Yet, the warnings have to go out in enough time to allow those in 
danger to flee. Along many pans of the coast, evacuating a threatened area can take more 
than 12 hours.
Warnings issued for Hurricane Hugo, which hit the Charleston, S.C., area in 
September 1989, illustrate how forecasters consider people's reactions as well as meteo-
rology. It's always a very narrow line you walk in trying to provide sufficient warning to 
protect life, but yet minimize the over-warning, Hurricane Center Director Robert Sheets 
says. We try to use a process that slowly elevates the level of alert.
As Hugo headed for the Southeast Coast, reports of its damage in Puerto Rico and 
the Virgin Islands ensured people were aware that it was a big hurricane, Sheets says. We 
started out by saying this hurricane will likely affect the Southeast Coast within the next 
two to three days somewhere between central Florida and North Carolina. We just 
painted a broad-brush kind of thing at this stage. What we're trying to generate is that 
people who had planned to go on vacation to those areas have second thoughts.
Around noon on Sept. 20, when Hugo was about a day and a half away from hitting 
land, I started saying we're likely to put up a hurricane watch from the central Florida 
area to somewhere in the North Carolina area either this evening or at the latest tomorrow 
morning. At 3 p.m. we put out an advisory that said we would put out a hurricane watch 
for some portion of that coast at 6 p.m.
A hurricane watch means that an area faces a threat of hurricane conditions within 24 
to 36 hours. Why not issue the watch at 3 p.m. instead of waiting until 6 p.m.? The extra 
three hours gave forecasters more time to refine their predictions, decreasing the area 
included in the watch. Sheets says word of the expected watch results in another level of 
alert... another group of people maybe start thinking about evacuating.
At 5:45 p.m. Sheets issued the watch for the coast from St. Augustine, Fla., to North 
Carolina's Outer Banks. He also said a hurricane warning would be issued at 6 the next 
morning for part of that area.
A watch doesn't necessarily mean people should evacuate; it tells them to be sure 
they're ready to go when the warning comes out. But, Sheets says, people who could 
evacuate without causing some major disruption in their lives indeed did evacuate. By the 
time we issued the warning the next morning we had somewhere between 30 and 40 
percent of the people off the barrier islands. We knew that those people who went out 
early are also the people that are least likely to complain after the fact. They're the 
cautious people that we love.
With partial, voluntary evacuation mostly completed when the hurricane warning 
was issued the morning of Sept. 21, less time was needed to evacuate the warned areas. 
Studies had shown that 16 to 18 hours would be needed to evacuate completely - if 
everyone waited until ordered to leave.

When the warning was issued, people still on the barrier islands were not encumbered 
by those people who have already left or who were planning to come for vacation and 
didn't come. The end result was a very positive flow of people away from the coast in a 
graduated and very deliberate fashion, Sheets says. At 3 p.m. the South Carolina 
governor's office reported that almost everyone was off the threatened islands. By 6 p.m. 
the fringes of Hugo were bringing strong winds and heavy rain that would have slowed 
evacuation, and Hugo's eye hit the coast around midnight.

Ups and downs of Atlantic hurricanes
	Since the middle of the 1960s, the East Coast and the Florida Peninsula have been 
enjoying a lull in major hurricanes - the monsters that do the most damage. At the same 
time, the numbers of Category 3 and stronger storms hitting the Gulf of Mexico Coast 
from Florida's Panhandle to Texas have stayed about the same.

William Gray of Colorado State University studies tropical cyclones all over the 
world. In the mid 1980s, he began asking what's going on? Why have major hurricanes 
apparently stopped hitting the Florida Peninsula and the East Coast? As Gray compared 
the number of tropical storms and hurricanes with global weather patterns, he discovered 
a strong statistical correlation between rainfall in West Attica and hurricane formation in 
the Atlantic.
Gray found a drop in the number of Category 3 or stronger Atlantic hurricanes when 
there was dry weather in West Africa - especially along the Gulf of Guinea and in the 
western Sahel region, on the south flank of the Sahara desert across Senegal, Mauritania, 
Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger; Nigeria and Chad.
While such statistical links are interesting, meteorologists look for physical links - A 
causes B, which in turn causes C. Researchers are finding complex links between such 
things as widespread patterns of ocean surface temperatures, African rainfall and the 
number of disturbances that grow into strong hurricanes. While they may occur at the 
same time, heavier West African rainfall doesn't cause stronger Atlantic hurricanes. Both 
are the results of the same global-scale weather pattern.
Gray's research doesn't say when an era of more numerous major hurricanes will 
return to the East Coast and Florida Peninsula, but it does indicate that we should expect 
such a return. Historical records and other; indirect evidence show that wet and dry 
periods that last decades are normal in West Africa. This means major hurricanes 
should return to places that have been enjoying a lull. When that happens, taking into 
account U.S. coastal population growth, Gray warns, there's going to be hell to pay.

How hurricanes are forecast
The National Hurricane Center is one of three National Weather Service 
forecasting centers, which illustrates how seriously the government takes hurricanes. 
The other two are the National Meteorological Center in Washington, D.C., which 
collects worldwide weather observations and produces the computer forecasts that are 
the basis of all other forecasts, and the National Severe Storms Forecast Center in 
Kansas City, Mo., which issues alerts for dangerous thunderstorms and tornadoes 
throughout the United States. Forecast offices in the states likely to be hit make 
predictions for winter storms.
The key advantage to having a special center for hurricane forecasts is that the 
forecasters become hurricane experts. This is important because even though hurricane 
forecasting, like all weather forecasting today, relies heavily on computer projections, the 
ultimate decisions are made by people who must understand these storms.

The center's forecasters rely on a half dozen different computer models. At times the 
computer projections literally are scattered all over the map. For instance, models might 
show the same storm in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico making landfall anywhere from 
the Texas-Mexico border eastward to the Florida Panhandle in the next 48 hours.
But the models are getting better, Sheets says. In fact, our models are better than the 
data we have to put into them. All computer forecasts have to start with data on what the 
weather is doing at the moment. Without good observations, the model can't make good 
forecasts.
Weather satellites provide invaluable information about where a storm is located, 
although it's not always possible to pinpoint a storm's center with only satellite views. 
Satellites also give clues as to whether a storm is strengthening or weakening. But 
satellite photos alone can't tell a forecaster where a hurricane is going to be 12 or 24, 
much less 48 or 72 hours from now. It can't tell a forecaster how strong the storm will be 
then. Yet, such information is what's needed to issue warnings.
A key to forecasting hurricane movement is figuring out what the winds for hundreds 
of miles around the storm will do. Such winds, known as the steering currents, account 
for about 80 percent of the storm's motion, Sheets says. If you can define that correctly, 
you can define the motion.
While today's satellites often can help tell forecasters what the winds around a storm 
are doing, they supply little information to predict what these winds will be doing in the 
future.
Forecasts for upper-air winds are based mostly on readings from instruments carried 
aloft by weather balloons twice a day all over the world. Over the United States and 
Europe, one such balloon goes aloft for about each 40,000 square miles.
In addition to providing photos, satellites measure temperatures and humidity at various 
levels in the atmosphere. These readings are needed to make wind forecasts. But, in the 
tropics at say 18,000 feet above the ocean, the satellite's temperature estimate may be 
around 3.5 F too high or too low. This doesn't sound like much, but Sheets says, it's 
virtually useless for wind forecasts. In the tropics you can just about guess the 
temperature that well. In the tropics very small changes can make a big difference in the 
weather.
	Right now, the Hurricane Center does a better job of forecasting hurricanes in the 
Gulf of Mexico than elsewhere because the Gulf is almost surrounded by weather stations 
that launch balloons. But the forecasts are far from perfect. Sheets says a Gulf storm 
coming in perpendicular to the coast is likely to hit within 30 miles of the impact point 
forecast 24 hours earlier. But, it may arrive sooner or later than forecast.
In 1989 forecasts for Hurricane Hugo, which followed a nearly perpendicular path to 
the Southeast Coast, worked out well. But, Sheets says, storms moving parallel to the 
East Coast cause more problems because there aren't enough weather balloon observa-
tions available on the storm's east side. A small change in heading can make a big 
difference in the winds and storm surge. Between the United States and Europe, only 
Bermuda sends weather balloons aloft regularly Sheets and his forecasters have one 
weather balloon for about 4 million square miles of tropical ocean. Better observations 
are available on the storm's west side.
In addition to more complete data, better forecasts also depend on learning more 
about how storms work. Forecasters would like a more complete picture of the 
complicated interactions between the storm and its steering currents. Sheets says 
researchers are winning this battle.
This leaves the problem of the lack of information to feed to the computers. A new 
generation of weather satellites, to be launched in the 1990s, will supply some of the 
needed data. But Sheets thanks the best bet is to move to a new generation of weather 
reconnaissance airplanes – to begin using jets.
Today's hurricane reconnaissance planes - Air Force WC-130s and the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's two WP-3s - can't cover as much space above 
and around a hurricane as forecasters want. They do a good job of defining the storm 
characteristics in the core of the hurricane, Sheets says. But they're only measuring half 
of the atmosphere needed for the forecasting models. The models need data as high as 
45,000 feet and for 1,000 miles away from the storm's center as well as in the eye.
Even though he's optimistic about improvements in hurricane forecasting, Sheets 
fears the Hurricane Center's skills won't be able to keep up with population growth along 
the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts. It's unrealistic to think coastal development will 
stop, he says. Yet every new home built on a barrier island increases the time needed to 
evacuate the island. Longer evacuation times mean accurate forecasts have to be made for 
periods that much further ahead.
In the next few years, Sheets expects to see the forecasts for a hurricane's location 30 
hours from when the forecast is made to be as good as the current 24-hour forecasts. But, 
if the time to evacuate a barrier island grows from 24 to 35 hours, the improved forecast 
won't help officials trying to decide on ordering evacuation. We have to progress rapidly 
just to stay even, Sheets says.

Keeping the death toll down
Sheets wishes local officials who allow development on coastal islands would spend 
more time worrying about evacuating the new residents when a storm threatens. They 
should think about extra bridges, raised bridges, four-lane roads, he says.
Officials of ocean-front communities with sturdy buildings, especially high-rise 
buildings, should also be thinking about what many call vertical evacuation -sheltering 
people in high-rise buildings that are likely to withstand a storm's winds and surge. 
Sheets says this is a good alternative for those who can't leave and go inland.
"I don't think it's reasonable for officials to simply say to people who are trapped on 
a barrier island, our plan was that you were going to get off. Since you didn't get off, 
you're now on your own. I think there has to be some plan in place. There could be a 
situation where it's no fault of the individual. They could have a boat break loose, a barge 
knocks out the bridge. It's not something you're going to penalize those people for 
because they didn't get out.
Sheets says he finds it hard to imagine a hurricane killing thousands of people in the 
United States, although some people would say you might get into the thousands of 
deaths. And that's certainly possible if you had people trapped on the barrier islands. It's 
my belief that if we have a major loss of life in a hurricane it is going to be people in their 
vehicles trapped on the roads, not people in their houses.
