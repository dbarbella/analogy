Everybody expects the weather to be changeable. We know some winters will be 
more frigid than average and some summers will be scorchers. Droughts will come and 
go and so will floods.
Until the 1970s, however most of us expected that over the long haul, the average 
temperature or precipitation would change little. We knew that the Earth bad been 
warmer at some times and colder at others, but these changes occurred over thousands of 
years. We didn't expect to see changes in climate. A region's climate is its average 
weather - including the normal variations - measured over decades, usually 30 years.
Climate was like the height of the Rocky Mountains; we didn't expect it to change 
during our lifetimes or even the lifetimes of our grandchildren.
Today, however, we regularly see news stones about the possibility of climate 
change in the near future. Congressional committees call upon scientists to testify about 
the climate. International conferences work out treaties designed to address potential 
climate changes. Books and television programs present scenarios of a greenhouse world 
of rising seas and food shortages by the middle of the next century.
Two of the largest issues involving the Earth's atmosphere have been in the news 
since the 1970s: destruction of ozone in the stratosphere, and the possibility that human 
activities will cause the Earth's average temperature to increase, usually called the green-
house effect.
While both issues involve the atmosphere of the entire Earth, there are two things to 
keep in mind.
First, scientists have figured out the key factors in the destruction of Earth's ozone 
layer and are giving policy makers concrete advice. Scientists are able to say with 
assurance that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and some other chemicals destroy ozone and 
the only practical way' to save the ozone is to stop releasing these chemicals into the 
atmosphere.
Second, while a greenhouse warming seems to be a likely result of carbon dioxide, 
methane, nitrous oxide and CFCs being added to the atmosphere, much remains to be 
learned about the Earth's climate system and its response to potential warming. Scientists 
are not able to give the firm answers about greenhouse effect that policy, makers want.
Understanding how Earth's climate works - and being aware of the literally millions 
of interactions that produce it - is the start of understanding how humans can affect our 
atmosphere.

Is the weather turning weird?
The hot, dry summer of 1988 got a lot of people talking about a possible climate 
change.
That year's drought was the worst in the USA since the 1930s Dust Bowl, and in 
some places it was worse. Hundreds of temperature records fell. In large parts of the 
Midwest and Plains, it was the hottest or second hottest summer on record. To many 
people, the heat and drought were proof of the greenhouse effect.
Then in December 1989 it turned bitterly cold, the coldest December on record in the 
East. Snow fell in Mobile, Ala. It was the fourth coldest December on record for the 
entire United States. To many people the cold and snow were proof that the greenhouse 
effect was just another scare story.
Most atmospheric scientists would call both proofs wrong; the climate just isn't that 
simple.
First, no particular heat wave or drought will ever be sufficient to prove greenhouse 
warming. Nor will the worst cold spell be evidence that greenhouse fears are groundless. 
The question will be answered by a huge collection of weather data from around the 
world over decades. And during those decades - even if greenhouse warming is found to 
be changing our average climate - some places might even turn cooler.
Second, as Richard Heim of the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C., 
can testify, our weather during the 1980s and into the 1990s hasn't been doing anything 
particularly unusual. There's nothing at all weird about our weather now or in the recent 
past.
As part of his work with the government's Global Climate Laboratory, Heim keeps 
track of current weather and compares it with the overall record to publish a monthly 
bulletin, U.S. Climate in Historical Perspective. In it he shows how each month's 
temperatures and precipitation compare with the same month in each year since 1895. 
The comparisons are done state-by-state, region-by-region, and across the entire United 
States. Similar rankings are done for seasons. Heim also tracks how much of the country 
is suffering from drought and how much is unusually wet.
I specifically try to search out weird weather. I try to come up with indices and 
analysis that will highlight if anything weird is going on that hasn't gone on before, he 
says. No matter what I try, everything I come up with for the last few years, even for the 
last couple of decades, has happened before.
I noticed that January, February and March have been really warm the last few years 
and there have been a lot of cold Decembers in the last eight or ten years or so. We're 
getting a wider swing in winter temperatures. Right? Calculate this for the last 96 years. 
No big deal. It happened in the 1930s; it happened earlier. It's true there have been some 
wide swings, but it's also true they've happened before. You just can't make any startling 
discoveries.

Looking for climate clues
Records, such as those being collected and studied at the Asheville center are the 
only way to catch subtle changes in averages that will be clues to whether the climate is 
changing, and if so, in what direction. In addition to keeping American records, the center 
is gathering records from around the globe and merging them to obtain a coherent picture 
of the world's weather since recordkeeping began.
Heim says trustworthy data for most of the United States goes back only to 1895. To 
extend the national climate record further into the past, the center is working with the 
records kept at Army forts around the country earlier in the 19th century, adjusting them 
to be comparable with 20th century data. Someday, Heim hopes to be able to compare 
droughts before the 1890s, for example, with current ones.
Collecting records of temperature and precipitation is only the beginning. Scientists 
at the Climatic Data Center are working to relate the old records to current data. Heim 
explains that thermometers and other weather instruments used in the past wouldn't 
necessarily agree with today's instruments. Then too, the procedures for making 
observations have changed from time to time and from country to country. Studying the 
old instruments and how they were used enables the laboratory to devise mathematical 
formulas allowing valid comparison of old and new records.

The historical picture
While accounts of big storms, major freezes and unusually hot summers help 
scientists reconstruct climates of the past, indirect records are also important guides. For 
example, old maps showing the extent of glaciers in the Alps help show that in the 17th 
century Europe was colder than it is today. Detailed records of wine production in France 
can help climatologists reconstruct year-to-year weather changes.
Nature also has left us millions of clues. Fossil plants, pollen and animals are good 
climate indicators, since certain plants and animals thrive in particular climates. Growth 
rings of trees tell the story of good and poor growing seasons far into the past. Bubbles of 
air in ice caps show what the atmosphere was like when falling snow trapped the air. 
Rocks deposited by glaciers continue to help researchers map the extent and timing of 
glaciers around the world.
Using such indirect evidence, scientists have a good idea of the ups and downs of 
Earth's climate in the past. Such knowledge supplies good tests for the computer models 
being used to try to forecast future climates.
By studying the past, by documenting what's happened in the past, we have a ground 
truth, or a picture of what has happened, says John Kutzbach of the University of 
Wisconsin at Madison. If we can come up with physical explanations, put them into our 
models and check to see whether the model calculates a climate very different from the 
present, but one that agrees with what actually happened, then we've increased our confi-
dence that we're on the right track.

Astronomical, geological effects on climate
We'll divide the things that affect our climate into two groups. Those in the first 
group are like one-way streets; the effects travel one way. The forces affect the climate 
without climate affecting them.
The second, far more complicated, set of forces are like two-way streets; the effects 
travel both ways. These forces affect the climate and are, in turn, themselves affected by 
the climate.
First we'll look at the one-way forces. The major one-way force is the amount of 
solar energy reaching the Earth. Other one-way forces are collisions of large objects - 
such as asteroids - with the Earth, geological factors such as movements of the continents 
or the growth of mountains and, finally, volcanoes.
As we saw in Chapter 2, the sun is the source of energy that drives the weather. It's 
natural to assume that changes in the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth would 
affect climate. Earlier we saw how solar astronomer John Eddy gathered evidence linking 
a reduction in sunspots with the Little Ice Age of the 15th to 18th centuries.
Theories about how changes in the sun's energy output could affect weather or 
climate are controversial. Not all scientists agree with Eddy about the sunspot-Little Ice 
Age link, but most have come to accept theories of how changes in the Earth's orbit can 
affect climate.
In the 19th century, scientists speculated that orbital changes could account for the 
series of ice ages that have marked the Earth's geological history. But neither a detailed 
theory nor convincing evidence was available. Milutin Milankovitch, a Yugoslavian 
mathematician, worked out a theory of Earth orbit in the 1920s and 1930s and gave a 
timetable of changes that could trigger the beginnings and ends of ice ages. Finally by the 
1980s geologists had collected enough evidence to show the timing of ice ages agreed 
with Milankovitch's theory.
Milankovitch found three factors that determine how much solar energy reaches 
different parts of the Earth: the shape of the orbit, the time of year the Earth is nearest the 
sun, and the Earth's tilt. All three factors are on different schedules, ranging from around 
22,000 to 100,000 years. At times the cycles work together to start or end ice ages.

While the sun is by far the most important astronomical force affecting climate, 
there's also the possibility that large objects, such as asteroids more than five miles wide, 
have collided with the Earth. In the past and could collide with the Earth in the future, 
throwing up clouds of dust that could prevent sunlight from reaching the surface, thus 
cooling the Earth for years. Many scientists think such a collision around 65 million years 
ago caused the extinction of large animals, including the dinosaurs, along with plant and 
animal life in the oceans. Some scientists are urging increased astronomical observations 
that would detect any such objects in the future, with the idea of being able to destroy or 
deflect them.
Geological effects on climate include the changing size and arrangement of the 
continents and oceans and the growth or erosion of mountains over millions of years. 
How much of the Earth is covered by water and the locations of land, especially 
mountains, make big differences in climate.
While the movements of continents take millions of years to affect the climate, a 
volcanic eruption can spew enough material into the air within hours to cause many 
months of weather changes around the globe.
A case that's often cited is the tremendous explosion of Mount Tambora, in what is 
now Indonesia, in April 1815. It ejected as much as 48 cubic miles of material, killing an 
estimated 10,000 people immediately. Dust from the volcano spread around the Earth and 
created spectacular sunsets for a year. Though not a completely proven scientific cause 
and effect, the dust is often linked to the so-called 1816 year without a summer in 
western Europe and eastern North America, which was unusually chilly with widespread 
crop failures.
The size of a volcanic eruption is only part of the story. To affect climate a volcano 
needs to eject material, especially sulfate particles, higher than nine or 10 miles above 
Earth where stratospheric winds can spread them around the world. If the material goes 
only into the troposphere, the lower eight or so miles of the atmosphere, precipitation 
washes it out of the air in a few days or weeks. Intensive studies of volcanic plumes, such 
as the one created by the 1991 eruptions of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, should 
answer some of the questions about the effects of volcanoes on climate.

Interactions inside the climate system
Now that we've looked at the one-way forces affecting climate, let's turn to those on 
a two-way street, those that are affected by the climate even as they affect it. These parts 
of the climate system are:
?	The atmosphere
?	The hydrosphere - Earth's water; especially the oceans
?	The cryosphere - ice caps, sea ice and glaciers
?	The biosphere - all living things
In this chapter; most of the estimates of temperature and other changes are from the 
1990 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Scientific Assessment, sponsored by 
the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme. 
Several hundred scientists from 25 countries participated. While not all the experts in all 
the scientific fields involved agree with everything in the report, it is a good starting point 
for talking about climate change.
Assuming the world's nations continue adding the same amounts of greenhouse 
gases to the atmosphere as they do now, the report estimates the world's average 
temperature would be about 10 Celsius (about 1.8 F) warmer in the year 2025 than in 
1990. This might not sound like much of a change, but it could have important 
consequences.
Greenhouse warming doesn't mean merely adding a few degrees to today's average 
high and low temperatures. We would still have frigid outbreaks, but heat waves would 
become more common. Some places would become drier; others wetter. Some places 
could become cloudier; others clearer. Detailed, regional effects of a warming are not 
known.

Positive and negative feedback
Positive feedback pushes the climate further in one direction. Negative feedback 
tends to slow the climate's movement in a particular direction.
Snow and ice are examples of positive feedback. They reflect more sunlight back to 
space than bare ground or water; helping cool the region. Therefore, the snow and ice are 
even less likely to melt and precipitation is more likely to be snow than rain.
Positive feedback can work the other way, too. It can encourage melting, once 
started, to continue. People in places covered by winter snow see this every spring. As 
warm days begin, the snow melts slowly at first. But once a few bare spots appear; the 
sun begins to warm the snow-free ground. As the ground warms up, it warms the air 
above it. This helps melt more snow. Those first few spots of bare ground start positive 
feedback that melts snow.
Clouds offer an example of negative feedback for surface temperatures. A day that 
starts out with clear sides will warm up. But sometimes clouds form, stop ping the 
warming by blocking the sun. The growth of clouds is a negative feedback to the day's 
warming. In fact, if the clouds grow into thunderstorms, downdrafts can bring down cool 
air, causing the temperature to drop.
While these examples are easy to understand, the ultimate effect of clouds on climate 
is not obvious.


Current cloud research
The number one goal of the United States Global Change Research Program is to 
learn more about clouds and their potential effects on climate. Scientists trying to 
determine how the climate will respond to a buildup of greenhouse gases need to know 
how cloud cover will change and whether it will tend to make the Earth warmer or keep it 
from warming.
If an increase in greenhouse gases warms the air, the air could hold more water 
vapor. The additional vapor could cause the Earth's clouds, on the average, to be thicker 
or to cover a larger area than at present.
Clouds can cool the climate by reflecting sunlight, keeping it from reaching the 
ground. Clouds may also warm the Earth by radiating infrared energy downward. The 
question for climate modelers is: Which effect will predominate as greenhouse gases 
increase?
How much sunlight a cloud reflects and how much infrared energy it radiates 
downward depend on the cloud's altitude, its thickness, and the nature of its water 
droplets or ice crystals.
Researchers are trying to answer a chain of questions about climate and clouds: How 
is warming likely to affect weather patterns? What kinds of clouds will the new patterns 
create and where will they be? And finally, will the most likely kinds of clouds bring 
positive or negative feedback for global warming?

Greenhouse gases
The greenhouse gases are important because we need the greenhouse effect for the 
world to be habitable. Water vapor is the main greenhouse gas that helps give the Earth 
its current temperature, but it's not usually discussed when we talk about the greenhouse 
effect because human activities don't directly affect how much water vapor is in the air.
If the Earth had no atmosphere, or an atmosphere with no greenhouse gases, but 
radiated away the same amounts of infrared energy as it does now, the average 
temperature at the surface would be around 0 F.
Instead, thanks to the greenhouse gases, the Earth's surface temperature averages 
around 59 F. The problem, then, isn't the greenhouse effect. It's the enhanced greenhouse 
effect caused by human activity adding carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and CFCs 
to the atmosphere.

How ice plays a role
Large amounts of frozen water in the Greenland and Antarctic ice caps - as sea ice 
around the polar regions and mountain glaciers elsewhere - help create our climate by 
increasing the temperature contrast between polar regions and the mid latitudes, including 
the United States.
As the drawing above shows, air over ice-covered polar regions grows colder than it 
would otherwise be, increasing the contrast between it and air farther from the poles. As 
we saw in Chapter 3, strong cold-warm air contrasts supply more energy for storms than 
weak contrasts. But, stronger winds caused by larger contrasts push more arctic air south 
and bring more warm air north, warming the polar regions. The system creates a negative 
feedback.
Warren Washington of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, 
Col., notes another effect of sea ice. Locking up water as ice reduces the amount of sea 
water that evaporates into the air. If polar regions warmed up enough in the future to melt 
some of the ice, more water would evaporate into the air; which could increase snowfall 
not only over the ocean, but also over nearby land.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that by the year 2030 sea 
levels around the world will rise an average of seven inches if we don't cut greenhouse 
emissions between now and then.
According to the estimates, most of this sea-level rise would result from thermal 
expansion of water as the oceans warm up. Water, like anything else, expands when it 
warms. Only a small pan of the sea-level rise would come from melting of mountain 
glaciers and small ice caps. As the drawing at the top of Page 194 shows, a greenhouse 
warming could cause the huge Antarctic ice sheet to grow. This could hold back sea-level 
rise by a small amount.

Water's role in the climate
The term hydrosphere refers to all of the water on Earth. Water affects climate by 
taking up and releasing heat as it changes among its phases – vapor, liquid and ice. Both 
the amount of water that falls as precipitation and the amount available to be evaporated 
help determine a region's climate.
Oceans are a major player in climate. They hold large amounts of heat and move it 
around via global-scale currents.
Since the oceans cool or warm slowly they slow the temperature changes in the air 
above them. This is why places near the ocean don't have temperature contrasts as large 
as places far inland. Summer winds are cool and winter winds are warm.
Scientists refer to this slowing of temperature changes by the oceans as terminal 
inertia.
Ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic, play a key role in climate 
by moving warm or cool water from one place to another. Ocean temperatures also help 
determine the locations of large high- and low-pressure areas such as the Bermuda High 
and the Aleutian Low.
The atmosphere also affects the oceans. Winds help create currents and the amounts 
and locations of clouds help determine the ocean's temperature. More than the winds, 
however, cause the large ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream.
As water cools in the northern oceans, it becomes more dense and sinks to flow 
southward deep in the ocean. Water flowing in to replace sinking water helps cause 
northward-flowing currents.
Since the amount of salt helps determine the density of sea water, anything that 
makes it less salty, such as more rain than normal, will make northern water less likely to 
sink. This could weaken northward currents.
Warren Washington says such an effect shows up in a computer model that combines 
the atmosphere with realistic ocean models that include ocean currents. The drawing 
below shows how this works.

How living things affect climate
The word biosphere refers to all of the Earth's living things - from microbes to the 
largest plants and animals. All have the potential to affect the climate.
Carbon dioxide, the most important of the greenhouse gases, has an elaborate 
natural cycle. Plants take it from the air to make plant material, which becomes part of 
animals that either eat plants or eat other animals that eat plants. Marine creatures end 
up carrying large amounts of carbon to the bottom of the ocean when they die and sink, 
locking up carbon for thousands of years.
Carbon dioxide is released into the air when vegetation decomposes or is burned. 
Burning fossil fuels, which were once living things, adds carbon dioxide to the air. 
Large amounts of carbon are locked up in living things, the oceans, fossil fuels, the soil 
and rocks.
Methane is another greenhouse gas that is in the air naturally, but it is being 
increased by human activities. It is created by reactions involving microbes. The biggest 
source is natural wetlands - methane is often called swamp gas - but rice paddies add 
almost as much to the air. The world's third largest source is fermentation in the 
stomachs of animals such as cattle and sheep.
Nitrous oxide is also a greenhouse gas being increased by human activity. Nitrate 
and ammonium fertilizers are thought to add nitrous oxide to the air as they break down.
CFCs are the only greenhouse gases produced solely by humans.
The biosphere is a two-way street. The climate's effects on living things are as 
obvious as the difference between the vegetation of a desert and that of a rain forest. 
Variations in climate change plant and animal life.

How El Nino works
The best-known example of how the ocean and atmosphere are interconnected is the 
set of patterns known as El Nino, or more properly, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation 
(ENSO).
While the land near the coast of Peru is a desert, the nearby ocean is one of the 
world's most productive fishing grounds. Sea life is abundant because cold water, rich in 
nutrients, is coming up - called upwelling -along the coast as winds push surface water 
away.
The name El Nino comes from the Spanish-speaking people who live along the 
Pacific Coast of Peru. Each year in late December, a southward moving current warms 
the water. The Peruvians started calling the warm current El Nino - boychild, for the 
Infant Jesus - because it comes around Christmas. Every few years the ocean warming is 
greater than normal and leads to disruption of the usually abundant fish and other marine 
life. It also can bring flooding rains to the desert of northwestern Peru. Until 1957, El 
Nino was thought to affect only South America's west coast. Now we know it's part of a 
global chain of ocean and atmospheric events.
In 1904, British mathematician Gilbert Walker became director of scientific 
observatories in India. He wanted to find a way to predict the Indian monsoon. His hope 
was to forecast dry growing seasons in time to avoid famine like the one that followed the 
1899-1900 monsoon failure. In 1924, Walker described a seesaw pattern in tropical 
Pacific air pressure. He found when air pressure is low around Australia, it's high to the 
east, around Tahiti. When the pressure is high around Australia, it's low in Tahiti. This is 
the Southern Oscillation. It was interesting, but at the time didn't seem important.
Then in 1957 and 1958, a strong El Nino occurred off the South American Coast. 
This happened during the International Geophysical Year when more measurements than 
usual were being made. These showed that water was warming all the way to the west of 
the International Date Line, a quarter of the way around the globe. The extensive 
Geophysical Year measurements also caught unusual air-pressure and wind patterns in 
the northern Pacific and aver North America.
By the 1970s, scientists realized that El Nino and the Southern Oscillation are part of 
a huge ocean-atmosphere system that can be felt far away from its tropical home. The 
drawings on Page 195 show how the system works.
An extremely strong El Nino-Southern Oscillation in 1982 and 1983 focused new 
international attention on the phenomenon.
Records going back to the 19th century show that some El Nino years are wet along 
the U.S. West Coast, some dry; and others bring average precipitation. During a 1976-77 
El Nino, northern California suffered record drought. But the 1982-83 event brought a 
series of storms from the fall into the spring that did millions of dollars in damage along 
the West Coast, including an estimated $200 million damage in California alone.
French Polynesia normally goes years between hurricanes, but the 1982-83 El Nino 
brought five, including one that left 25,000 people homeless on Tahiti. The El Nino was 
linked to floods in Louisiana, Florida, Cuba, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia and to droughts 
in Hawaii, Mexico, southern Africa, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Australia. In 
Australia the drought was the worst on record.
In response to the 1982-83 global weather disruption, the World Meteorological 
Organization began the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere (TOGA) program. The 
10-year program began in 1985. Its goal is to gain a better understanding of El Nino so 
scientists can forecast future events and their likely results.

Computer and climate
The computer models used to study climate have some things in common with those 
used to forecast weather that we describe in Chapter 11. Like the weather forecasting 
models, they use laws of physics that describe the atmosphere's changes. And, like 
weather forecasting models, supercomputers are needed to run today's climate models.
But there are differences. Climate models have to take into account things weather 
forecasting models can ignore, such as ocean currents, and the increase or decrease of 
certain kinds of plants or animals.
The major challenge for scientists developing climate models is to fit all of the 
components together Warren Washington, at the National Center for Atmospheric 
Research, says that until the late 1980s we didn't couple even crude ocean models to the 
atmospheric models. The atmospheric models had static oceans that would store heat and 
give it up. But the models didn't factor in ocean currents.
New models are passing one important test of matching the real world, Washington 
says. We're finding in our newest calculations with interactive ocean models that we 
generate El Ninos at about the same frequency as the real world. One of the things that 
the model shows, which has to be confirmed with more studies, is that the El Ninos in a 
greenhouse-warmed atmosphere would be stronger. The potential for affecting important 
regional features such as monsoons is kind of disturbing.
These are the kinds of things models turn up that might not otherwise be expected. 
One of the key hopes for the models is that they will indicate how regional climates are 
likely to change. At the present time, the models don't do a very good job of such 
predictions. Different models generally do agree that a greenhouse warring would be 
greatest in polar regions. And many point to the central United States warming by as 
much as an average of 7 F in the winter and around 5 F in the summer, with the winters 
wetter but the summers drier than today.
Those who develop climate models don't look for real improvements in the ability to 
predict regional climates before at least the year 2000.

The greenhouse debate
Uncertainties and disagreements among climate models combined with the 
complexities of the climate system fuel the debate about what, if anything, should be 
done to head off or reduce possible greenhouse warming. One example of the conflicting 
information is predictions of the Earth's temperature increase caused by a doubling of 
carbon dioxide in the air Some models predict it would be as low as about 3 F, while 
others go as high as 9 F. Most are close to 7 F.
Daniel Albritton, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 
Aeronomy Laboratory in Boulder; Col., says there's no doubt that the amounts of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased and that these gases will decrease the 
amount of infrared radiation escaping from the Earth. The response of the atmosphere is 
where the questions are legion, he says. How is the climate - this loose-jointed, physical, 
biological system that we have such poor understanding of - going to respond?
Will clouds turn out to provide a positive or negative feedback to warming? What is 
the role of the oceans with their thermal inertia? How much carbon dioxide are the 
oceans absorbing and how much will they absorb as they warm up? These are some of 
the questions at the heart of the debate. And scientists are only beginning to explore how 
the biosphere and atmosphere interact.
If the models are correct, the greenhouse warming in the next century would be the 
fastest climate change in the Earth's history, certainly the biggest humans have ever 
faced. It could also make the Earth warmer than ever before in human history. Albritton 
says this makes some scientists wonder if the Earth has a thermostat that limits 
temperature changes.
These factors, among others, mean scientists can't offer any clear-cut answer about 
the greenhouse effect to policy makers.
Since greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, are the main agents of a potential 
global warming, most scientists agree the best response is to reduce the amount of carbon 
dioxide being added to the atmosphere. This becomes an economic and political question.
The key to reducing carbon dioxide emissions is to burn less fossil fuel. But that 
could slow the economies of the wealthy countries. Poor countries could suffer even 
more. China, for instance, has huge deposits of coal, but burning coal adds more carbon 
dioxide to the atmosphere than any other fuel.
One side argues that the incomplete scientific knowledge doesn't justify the 
economic risk of cutting hack on fossil fuel. The other side argues that the potential 
consequences are too great not to act.
Those in favor of reducing the amount of fossil fuel burned also argue that even if 
global warming wasn't a concern, we would reap other benefits such as a reduction in air 
pollution.
Since clear-cut scientific answers seem unlikely until at least early in the next 
century, decisions - which could include deciding to do nothing - will have to be based 
more on convictions about the right balance between potential environmental harm and 
potential economic harm than on scientific facts.

A clear danger: Ozone destruction
The potential danger to the Earth's ozone layer wasn't discovered until 1974, but the 
story goes back to 1928 when chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were invented to replace 
dangerous compounds, such as ammonia, then used in home refrigerators. Until the mid-
1970s, CFCs seemed like a miracle chemical. Even though they contain chlorine, which 
can be dangerous, they didn't break down in the atmosphere or react with other 
chemicals. As long as it's locked up in CFCs, chlorine is harmless. CFCs were a perfect 
fluid for refrigerators and during the 1950s they were also found to work as spray-can 
propellants and as solvents.
More CFCs were escaping into the air; but since they were considered harmless, it 
was of little concern. You didn't have to feel guilty about the Freon - the brand name of 
one of the widely used CFCs - that escaped from your car's air conditioner or from the 
old refrigerator you junked. In the early 1970s, however, Sherwood Rowland and Mario 
Molina at the University of California at Irvine, began to wonder what was happening to 
all the CFCs being released into the atmosphere. By 1974, their studies led to the 
conclusion that the CFCs were rising into the stratosphere where they would eventually 
break down, freeing their chlorine, allowing it to destroy ozone.
Scientists had known since 1881 that ozone in the stratosphere blocks much of the 
sun's dangerous ultraviolet radiation from reaching the Earth's surface. Scientists later 
discovered that an increase in ultraviolet radiation could cause skin cancer and harm 
other living things, including crops.
Ozone is a form of oxygen. Each molecule of ordinary oxygen consists of two 
oxygen atoms. Each molecule of ozone consists of three oxygen atoms. Small amounts of 
ozone occur naturally near the surface, but larger concentrations build up in the 
stratosphere about 10 to 20 miles above the Earth.
In the stratosphere, ultraviolet radiation from the sun is absorbed as it hits ozone 
molecules, breaking them apart. The absorbed energy warms the stratosphere. But most 
important, by absorbing ultraviolet radiation, ozone acts as a shield.
After ultraviolet energy breaks apart stratospheric ozone molecules, nearly all of the 
freed oxygen atoms eventually recombine into ozone. Until recently, the natural 
destruction and creation of ozone were generally in balance; the shield was intact.
But CFC molecules reaching the stratosphere tip the balance. Ultraviolet radiation 
breaks the CFC molecules apart, freeing chlorine atoms. These chlorine atoms destroy 
ozone. The chemical reactions are complicated, but the end result is that each chlorine 
atom can destroy thousands of ozone molecules. Now we have chlorine atoms as well as 
ultraviolet radiation destroying ozone molecules. Natural processes that create ozone no 
longer can keep up with the destruction.
In 1979, concern about the threat to the stratosphere's ozone layer led the United 
States, Canada, Norway and Sweden to ban the use of CFCs as propellants in most spray 
cans. Worldwide use of CFCs leveled off.
But, says Susan Solomon of NOAA's Aeronomy Laboratory, use started back up in 
the early 1980s with the revolution in consumer electronics. CFCs are used to clean 
electronic chips. Your personal computer; your VCR, your telephone answering machine, 
all those things you didn't have 10 years ago, you now have partly because they were 
cleaned with CFCs.
As CFC use grew; scientific concern about the danger to stratospheric ozone 
increased. But all of the chlorine CFCs added to the stratosphere weren't destroying 
ozone right away. Researchers found that other substances in the stratosphere were 
locking up large numbers of chlorine atoms in chemical reservoirs. Until 1985, scientists 
expected that with so much chlorine locked up in these reservoirs, only about five percent 
of the stratosphere's ozone would be destroyed by the year 2050.
Ozone was being destroyed, but the rate seemed to be slow enough to allow time to 
find a solution. Makers of CFCs argued that without evidence of massive ozone 
destruction, banning such useful products didn't make sense.
In 1985, evidence of massive ozone destruction caught scientists by surprise when 
the British Antarctic Survey reported ozone was disappearing from the sky over its 
Halley Bay, Antarctica, station during the Southern Hemisphere spring. The British 
scientists measured losses as great as 40 percent over Antarctica. Measurements from 
satellites and other ground stations confirmed the British report.
Someone came up with the phrase ozone hole to describe this unexpected thinning of 
the ozone layer over Antarctica. No matter what people called it, scientists now had to 
find out what was going on. Was something freeing chlorine from its stratospheric 
reservoirs?
Researchers, including Solomon, found in 1986 and 1987 that the unique winter 
conditions in the stratosphere over Antarctica - the coldest part of the stratosphere - were 
freeing chlorine from its reservoirs, enabling it to destroy ozone.
While loss of ozone over Antarctica wasn't an immediate threat to life, scientists 
know that in the summer, air over the South Pole mixes with the rest of the stratosphere. 
Ozone-poor air from around the South Pole could eventually dilute ozone elsewhere. 
Also, scientists wondered, could whatever was happening over Antarctica eventually 
happen elsewhere?
Researchers who went to the Antarctic in 1986 with the National Ozone Expedition 
returned pointing to chlorine from CFCs as a main ozone depleter. In September 1987, 
the United Nations adopted the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone 
Layer. Among other things it required a 50 percent reduction in CFC production by the 
year 2000.
Also in 1987, a series of aircraft fights over Antarctica, including flights by NASA's 
version of the former U-2 spy airplane, the ER-2, added details to the 1986 discoveries. 
The 1987 flights provided clear evidence of how Antarctica's polar stratospheric clouds 
were key factors in the chain of chemical reactions that freed chlorine from its reservoirs. 
Even more important, the 1987 research left no doubt that chlorine from CFCs and 
bromine from chemicals known as halons - used in some fire extinguishers - were 
destroying ozone.
In 1987 and 1988, scientists confirmed that reactions similar to those over Antarctica 
were going on over the Arctic, but not to the same extent as over the colder Antarctic.
Scientists expect to continue learning more about ozone destruction. On Sept.12, 
1991, the Space Shuttle Discovery launched the Upper-Atmosphere Research Satellite to 
study the stratosphere, especially the ozone layer.
This satellite research should help answer questions about the most recent threat to 
ozone, the eruption of the Mount Pinatubo volcano in the Philippines on June 15, 1991. 
Scientists fear that the huge amounts of sulfur dioxide the volcano shot into the 
stratosphere could eventually destroy ozone.
While scientists still have much to learn about the details of exactly how substances 
added to the atmosphere affect ozone, they have a good overall picture of what's going 
on.
In 1990, when the nations that had signed the 1987 Montreal Protocol met in London 
to review the treaty scientists presented convincing evidence of how CFCs lead to ozone 
destruction. This evidence persuaded the policy makers to speed up reductions in CFC 
emissions and to phase out all CFC production - but not use – by the year 2000.
The ozone question is being answered but the greenhouse question still is being 
reviewed. Even though the interactions between man-made substances and stratospheric 
ozone are complicated, they are not nearly as complicated as the climate system. Also, 
Solomon says, she and others who discovered what was happening to ozone had things 
we could measure in a straightforward way over a limited time period.
Definite amounts of ozone are being destroyed. Scientists have found firm evidence 
that forms of chlorine and bromine that destroy ozone are in the air at the very time and 
place the ozone is being destroyed.
There's just not any simple thing you can measure for the climate problem, she says. 
Even the biggest change in average temperature expected as a result of greenhouse 
warming is smaller than normal, daily temperature changes. There's no unambiguous 
measurement to be made, such as the destruction of 40 percent of the stratosphere's ozone 
over Antarctica each spring.

Benefits of understanding climate
Climate is not a constant thing. It has always changed and it will always change, says 
Richard Heim of the Climate Center in Asheville. One thing that we would like to do as a 
people, is know what exactly has happened in the past and get some handle on what we 
can expect in the future, so we can plan for it. Maybe we can affect it for better or worse. 
Hopefully we'll be smart enough to affect it for better.
Understanding climate is an extension of understanding the weather. Someone who 
is weatherwise is less likely to become a victim of violent weather than a person who 
doesn't realize what's going on when the sky darkens. Nations, or a world, that understand 
climate are less likely to become victims of climatic change.
There's another benefit, a more personal one. Climate, like weather; is an intellectual 
challenge. Exploring climate can draw you into history, geology, astronomy, chemistry, 
physics and all of the branches of biology as well as meteorology; mathematics and 
computer science. Weather and climate are a good entry into the insights and pleasures of 
science - and the secrets of nature itself.
