What makes weather?
The sun.
Through the seasons, it heats our world; some parts more, some less. And, with the 
help of the Earth's rotation, this unequal heating becomes a giant engine that drives our 
weather
Anyone who has ever wilted outside on a sweltering summer day can figure out 
easily how the sun creates hot weather. But the connections are not so clear between the 
sun and hurricanes, or tornadoes, or blizzards, or the falling rain, or even long sieges of 
arctic cold.

How the sun creates energy
For centuries people thought of the sun as a giant object on fire, burning the way 
campfires burn. But imagine how much fuel you would need to keep that fire going. If 
something the size of the sun were made of gasoline and had enough oxygen to feed the 
flames it would burn about 10,000 years. That's a long time, but far short of the four and 
a half billion years the sun and Earth have existed.
Early this century, as we started learning more about radioactivity, scientists 
conjectured that somehow nuclear energy would explain the sun's power.
In 1938 Hans Bethe of Cornell University and Charles L. Critchaeld of George 
Washington University produced a theory explaining how nuclear fusion fuels the sun 
and other stars. A fusion reaction fuses atoms together creating other kinds of atoms and 
giving off energy. Fission reactions, like those used in today's nuclear power plants, split 
atoms to produce energy.

Besides the sun, the only source of heat on Earth is its molten core and radioactive 
rocks. While this heat supplies the energy to slowly push the continents around and 
build mountains, it hardly affects the weather. We encounter heat from deep below the 
Earth when geysers spew out water or when volcanoes erupt. And while a big volcano 
can darken the sky enough to affect the weather in some places, the impact is minor 
compared to the sun's daily work.

The sun's heat varies
Depending on the season and location, the sun bathes the Earth in widely varying 
amounts of energy. The result is a planet sharing frigid polar cold, sweltering tropical 
heat and all the temperatures in between - at the same time.
A heat engine depends on hot-cold contrasts to produce power. Your car is a good 
example. Power comes from the heat created by burning a mixture of gasoline and air in 
a cylinder. As the engine runs, its cylinders alternate between being hot and cooler. 
Power is produced.
Early in the 19th century, scientists discovered that the bigger the contrast between 
hot and cold in a heat engine, the more power it produces. That's why automotive 
researchers are looking for new materials that can withstand more heat than today's 
engine. An engine that could stand more heat would have bigger contrasts and produce 
the same power with less gasoline.
The atmosphere is similar. The stronger the hot-cold contrast, usually the stronger 
the storm.

Water holds the heat better
Land and water both absorb and give up heat. But land warms up and cools off more 
readily than water. Do your own science experiment. Go to the beach barefoot on a hot 
day at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon. The sand is almost too hot to walk on; the water is 
refreshingly cool. Now go back at midnight, especially on a clear night. The sand is chilly 
while the water has remained comfortably warm.
On a large scale, tropical oceans hold tremendous amounts of heat while polar water 
can be frigid year round. Land areas, on the other hand, quickly warm up or cool off with 
the seasons.

Earth's tilt makes the seasons
The seasons bring the biggest swings between hot and cold. They are caused by the 
Earth's year-long trip around the sun.
The illustration above is what you would see if you stayed out in space for a year 
watching the Earth orbit the sun. Imagine Earth's orbit as the outer edge of a disc. You'd 
see that the Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees in relation to this disc.
To get an idea of what you would really see, you should know this drawing makes 
the Earth much larger and much closer to the sun than it really is. Using the sun at the 
size here. To show the Earth's orbit in proper proportion, these pages would have to fold 
out to 14 feet on each side of the sun.
If the Earth were in proper proportion in that giant drawing, it would be only about 
.013 of an inch across - about the thickness of three or four human hairs.
A tilted globe and a flashlight - representing the sun - will help you understand the 
seasons as you read this page. Imagine watching one complete Earth orbit on fast-
forward. You'd notice, as shown in the drawings on the previous page, that the Earth's 
axis stays tilted in the same direction. This means that as the Earth orbits the sun, the 
Northern Hemisphere - at the top in the drawings - is tilted toward the sun in the summer, 
away from it in winter.
In late December, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, making it 
winter in the north. As the Earth moves in its orbit toward spring, the north's tilt away 
from the sun becomes smaller and smaller until the March 21 spring equinox, when the 
Earth's axis is tilted neither away from nor toward the sun.
The North Pole is tilted directly toward the sun at the summer solstice around June 
21. As we move from summer toward fall, the Southern Hemisphere begins tilting more 
toward the sun while the North tilts away. The fall equinox is a repeat of the spring 
equinox. As the Earth moves toward December, the North Pole tilts more and more away 
from the sun until the solstice, when it's pointing away from the sun at that 23.5 degree 
angle and we go back again to winter.
Now come back to Earth (in the illustration above) to see how its orbit affects the 
path that the sun traces across the sky through the seasons. This drawing represents the 
northern part of the United States - from about 100 miles north of Sacramento, Calif., 
across to Philadelphia.

SUMMER: Start with the summer solstice, the longest day of the year in the 
Northern Hemisphere. Because of the Earth's tilt, the sun is directly over the 
Tropic of Cancer; an imaginary line around the world, which comes closest to 
the U.S. mainland near Key West, Fla. It marks the northernmost point upon 
which the sun shines directly. On June 21 the sun rises in the northeast and sets 
in the northwest all over the world. At noon the sun is more than 70 degrees 
above the southern horizon along our line from Philadelphia to Sacramento. For 
every place north of the Tropic of Cancer, the sun is at its highest point in the 
sky and this is the longest day of the year. At the spring and fall equinoxes, the 
sun is directly above the equator. In the northern United States, it's about 50 
degrees above the southern horizon at noon. It rises almost exactly due east and 
sets in the west. Day and night are almost equally long all over the Earth.

WINTER:	At the winter solstice, the sun is directly above the Tropic of Capricorn, 
which cuts across Brazil, South Africa and Australia. This is the sun's lowest point in the 
sky in the Northern Hemisphere. At noon in the northern U.S., the sun is only about 25 
degrees above the southern horizon. The sun rises in the southeast and sets in the 
southwest. Its short path makes this the Northern Hemisphere's shortest day of the year.

The small amount of time the sun is in the sky at the winter solstice isn't the only 
reason less energy reaches Earth. As the sun crops lower and lower in the sky, its light 
and heat are being spread out over more surface area. To see how this works, take a 
flashlight and shine it straight down on a globe. Now shine it at a steep angle. You can 
see how the same amount of light - and heat - spreads out over a larger area when the sun 
is low in the sky.

Two other factors help determine how much solar energy reaches the Earth, but 
compared to the seasons - or even to the day-night cycle - both are bit players. First, 
during the year the Earth's distance from the sun changes constantly, but that has a minor 
effect on weather compared to the seasonal changes. In fact, the Earth is nearest the sun 
around Jan. 3 each year.

We're usually told the Earth is 93,000,000 miles from the sun. That's the average 
distance. Around Jan. 3 the sun is about 1,600,000 miles closer. Around July 4 it's about 
1,600,000 miles farther away.

Second, there is a tiny variation in the amount of energy the sun radiates. Scientists 
used to talk about the amount of the sun's energy reaching the top of the atmosphere as 
the solar constant. But once sensitive satellites started making measurements, researchers 
discovered that the solar constant isn't quite constant at all. There's a tiny variation - less 
than two-tenths of one percent. Sunspots are linked to this variation, as shown on the 
previous page.

Sunlight is only the beginning
Earth's orbit determines how much solar energy hits the top of the atmosphere, but 
not all of this reaches the ground. The amount reaching the surface to be absorbed is a 
key to determining the Earth's temperature. How much energy reaches the ground or 
oceans depends on whether the sky is clear or cloudy and whether the surface is dark or 
light.
Thick clouds, for instance, can reflect back as much as 95 percent of the solar energy 
hitting them. If the skies are perfectly clear; more solar energy will reach the ground. But 
if that ground is covered with sparkling, white snow; it will reflect back as much as 95 
percent of the sun's energy. A forest or ocean, on the other hand, will reflect less than 10 
percent of the sunlight hitting them, as the illustration below shows.

Most of the sun's radiation is visible light or what's known as the near infrared. The sun 
also radiates ultraviolet waves and even tiny amounts of microwaves and radio waves. 
The ways these various kinds of radiation act when they reach the Earth help start the 
complex chain of events that give our planet its pattern of air and water temperatures.

Just as important, the Earth and its atmosphere aren't only absorbing solar energy; 
they're also giving off energy. Everything, including you, emits energy. The kinds and 
amounts depend on temperature.

The next time you barbecue over coals you can watch how this works. The flame 
starts out bright orange or red but turns to a dull red as it dies. Even after all the glow is 
gone - no more visible light energy is being emitted - you can still feel the infrared 
energy, the heat, from the coals.

The mostly infrared energy being emitted by the Earth, by the atmosphere and by 
clouds combines with incoming solar energy, in a beautiful balancing act that determines 
temperature of the air and the Earth's surface.

How the balancing act works
A few facts can help you understand the balancing act. About 30 percent of the solar 
energy reaching the Earth is reflected, it never helps heat the Earth. About 20 percent is 
absorbed at various heights in the atmosphere. The remaining 50 percent is absorbed by 
the ground and oceans.
Much ultraviolet energy is absorbed high in the atmosphere, while the sun's infrared 
energy is absorbed at lower altitudes. Most of the visible light makes it through the 
atmosphere either to be reflected or absorbed by the ground.
Anything that absorbs energy warms up. Absorbed solar energy helps warm the 
atmosphere. Infrared energy that's always being radiated by the Earth is absorbed by the 
tiny water drops in the clouds and by water vapor and other gases in the atmosphere. 
Clouds that absorb infrared energy radiate some back to space, some back toward Earth. 
This is why cloudy' nights tend to be warmer than clear nights - everything else being 
equal. Clouds act like an infrared blanket.

The amounts of solar energy hitting the Earth and being absorbed and the amounts of 
infrared energy radiated toward the Earth from clouds and gases in the atmosphere 
determine how warm or cold the Earth's surface will be at any particular place.

Heat and cold balance out
If we look at the entire Earth over long periods of time, the heat budget seems to be 
in balance. While many scientists think the Earth is slowly warming up - it has cooled 
and warmed many times in the past - the evidence isn't clear cut.
This is what the debate over the greenhouse effect is all about. Many scientists fear 
that pollution is changing the atmosphere in ways that will reduce the amount of infrared 
energy being sent to space. If that happens, the Earth will warm up before a new balance 
between incoming and outgoing energy is struck.

While overall the Earth's heat budget is in balance, that's not true for individual pans 
of the Earth. Winter cold and summer heat are examples of local imbalances that change 
with the seasons.
To figure out the balance for a particular time and place, you first need to know how 
much solar energy is warming the ground. This depends on how long the sun is up, how 
high the sun is in the sky, how cloudy it is and what kind of surface the sunlight is hitting. 
Then you have to measure what's happening to the Earth's infrared energy, how much is 
being radiated, how much of it is escaping to space and how much is returning to Earth.

Tropical oceans or forests under clear skies will absorb a huge share of the solar 
energy hitting the Earth there during 12 hours of daylight. When you add what's 
happening to infrared energy at the same location, you will find that the air will be 
warmed. In Alaska snow-covered ground will absorb hardly any solar energy during the 
three hours of winter daylight. But the cold ground will continue to radiate away infrared 
energy', growing colder and colder. The coldest air comes from polar regions with mostly 
clear winter nights. The clear skies allow even more infrared energy to be lost to space. 
The ground will grow colder and colder because it's losing more energy than it's 
receiving.

While scientists have had a general idea of the energy balance for different pans of the 
Earth for years, they're just beginning to develop ways to measure energy deficits and 
surpluses over wide areas. Scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va., are using satellites to 
measure the amounts of energy corning and going from the ground all over the globe. 
Others are trying to precisely measure the amount of solar energy coming and going from 
the top of the atmosphere and the amount of infrared energy leaving the atmosphere for 
outer space. This is the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment Program.

The maps on the previous page are from NASA's Langley scientists. They show 
which areas of the Earth are losing radiative energy and which ones are gaining in 
January and July These maps show only the energy coming and going as radiation.

In January, places in the North continue to lose energy even though the days are 
growing longer. While the days are longer than they were on Dec. 21, they're still very 
short and the sun is low in the sky. It's still not strong enough to make up for the infrared 
energy being lost from the frigid ground. Spring warming begins when the sun's 
incoming energy Finally is greater than the lost infrared energy.

In July, as days are growing shorter; they still are long enough to supply more than 
enough solar energy to make up for the lost infrared energy. In most of the United States 
the weather continues growing warmer until around the middle or late part of July when 
the energy balance tips. The slow cooling at the end of summer begins when the amount 
of infrared energy escaping is greater than the incoming solar energy.

Air picks up heat and cold
Water and land heat or cool the air above them. This creates masses of hot, warm, 
cool or cold air. These air masses are huge, at least the size of several states. They form 
when the same air stays over an area for days, maybe a week or two, long enough for the 
air to warm up or cool down as it tries to match the ground or ocean below. In addition to 
warming or cooling, air masses also grow dry or humid to match the area where they 
form.
Air masses form mostly in the polar or tropical regions: the air in the middle latitudes 
doesn't stay still long enough. When air masses move from their home regions they 
bring us heat waves and cold spells. The air masses that control the USA's weather are:
Continental polar air masses that affect the United States most often originate 
over Alaska and northwestern Canada. The illustration on the previous page shows a 
typical early winter-air mass that might grow up in the area around Fairbanks, Alaska, 
and then move south into the Rockies or northern Plains.
As the cold air moves south, it is warmed by flowing over warmer ground. Even in 
the dead of winter, such heating can be significant. An air mass that leaves Alaska or 
southern Canada in January with daily high-low ranges from –20 F to 40 F will warm to a 
range of perhaps 25 F to 50 F by the time it reaches the Gulf Coast, Florida or Southern 
California.
Really bitter cold air, the kind that drops temperatures to around 20 F in Orlando, 
Fla., isn't likely to reach Florida unless the ground over much of the Midwest and 
South is covered by snow. Deep snow cover helps keep cold air from warming as it 
moves south.

?	Maritime polar air masses build up over the northern oceans. They aren't as cold 
as continental air masses - normally they're no colder than a little above freezing - 
but they are more humid. The chilly damp weather that moves into the Pacific 
Northwest is from the northern Pacific Ocean.
?	Maritime tropical air masses form over the warm water of the Gulf of Mexico and 
the Caribbean Sea. Warm air masses that grow over the Pacific Ocean south and west 
from California normally have little effect on the United States. The Pacific Ocean water 
off the California Coast is chilly; tropical Pacific air heading for California is usually 
cooled before reaching land.
Continental tropical air masses form over the deserts of the Southwest and 
Mexico These air masses give the Southwest its warm, dry climate, but they don't move 
into other parts of the United States as often as the maritime tropical air masses or polar 
air masses.

Water and air move heat
If the polar and tropical air masses didn't move south and north, the Earth's poles would 
grow colder and colder because the polar summer is too short to make up for winter's 
heat deficit. The tropics would grow warmer and warmer since they have no real winter 
to counteract the heat surplus. But the poles aren't getting colder and the tropics aren't 
getting hotter.
The Earth balances its heat budget by moving cold water and air from the poles 
toward the tropics and warm water and air from the tropics toward the poles.
The movement of water does about 40 percent of the job of balancing the heat 
budget through global ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic or the 
Alaska Current in the Pacific. Movements of warm and cold air masses do about 60 
percent of the budget balancing. The hot-cold balancing act is always going on. This is 
where our weather begins, bringing not just hot or cold temperatures, but also - as we'll 
see - stirring up other kinds of weather.
