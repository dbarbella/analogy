Your population must consume food to survive.
Every citizen consumes two food points per turn.
The food points per turn consumed by settlers depends on the government.
Under anarchy, despotism, monarchy, and communism, settlers consume one food point per turn.
Under republic and democracy, settlers consume two food points per turn.
This food comes from the city that is supporting them.
Using a citizen to work a piece of terrain can produce food points.
Most terrain produces less than two food points per turn.
Some terrain has special properties so it produces more food points.
Improving a piece of terrain can improve its ability to produce food.
Every city can store food points.
Building a granary in a city enhances its capacity to store food points.
A city that produces more food than it requires accumulates the excess.
A city that produces less food than it requires draws food from storage.
The city population starves when the food storage is not sufficient to meet the food needed on a turn.
Settlers and citizens die until the food needed is equal to the food stored.
Settlers die first, followed by citizens.
When the food storage capacity becomes full, the population grows by one citizen.
This growth causes the food storage to become empty. 
Food storage capacity of a city increases with its population.
This means that each new citizen is more costly than the last.
