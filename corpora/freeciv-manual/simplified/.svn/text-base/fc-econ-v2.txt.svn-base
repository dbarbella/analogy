Cities need food every turn.
The food required in a city depends on the size of the city.
The size of a city is the number of its citizens.
The food required in a city depends on the number of citizens.
The food required in a city depends on the number of settlers.
The food required in a city depends on the city's total food consumption.
The food consumption of citizens is two food points per turn.
The food consumption of settlers depends on the government.
Under anarchy, despotism, monarchy, and communism, the food consumption of settlers one food point per turn.
Under republic and democracy, the food consumption of settlers is two points per turn.

Food production occurs within cities.
City food production depends on the number of citizens working.
The city food production depends on the terrain being worked.
Most terrain produces less than two food points per turn.
Some terrain produces more food points because that terrain has special properties.
Irrigating a tile increases food production.

Every city has a storage capacity.
If the city food production is greater than the food required in the city, a city accumulates food.
If the city's food production is less than the food required in the city, the city loses food.
Starvation occurs if the food stored would become negative.
During starvation, settlers die first, followed by citizens, until the food stored would be zero.  

When the amount of food stored in a city becomes full, the population grows by one citizen.
The growth causes the amount of food stored in the city to become empty. 
Building a granary in a city increases its growth rate.
With a granary in a city, the amount of food stored becomes half-full after growth.
The amount of food stored in a city needed to reach full depends on the population of the city.
This means that each new citizen is more costly than the last.

Every city produces at least one production point per turn.
The production points required in a city depend on the number of units in the city.
These units include military units, settlers, workers, and engineers.
The production point consumption of units is one production point per turn.
Under some governments, a few units are supported for free.
If the city's production points are less than the production points required, a unit is disbanded.
Building a product consumes extra production points. 

Cities can build units, buildings, or wonders. 
When the amount of production points used to create a product reaches the cost of the product, that product is complete.
Products appear in their city when complete.
Completed units appear on the map.
Completed buildings are added to the city's list of structures.
Completed wonders are added to the city's list of structures.
Any extra production points after something is completed are applied towards the next project.
Each city can have only one of each type of building.
Some buildings require that another is built first.
Each wonder can only be completed by one civilization per game.
If you produce units or buildings that you cannot support, they will be disbanded immediately after completion.
Building a settler consumes one citizen.
Building a settler consumes production points.
If a city builds a settler with its last citizen, that city will disband when the settler is completed.

The product a city is building can be changed on any turn.
The accumulated production points are used towards the new product.
Switching products during construction can be costly.
No points are lost in switching between different types of units, different types of buildings, or different wonders.
Otherwise, half of the accumulated production points are lost.

You can spend gold to complete a project in one turn.
The purchase cost of the product depends on the total production needed.
As the accumulated production of the city rises, the purchase cost of the product falls.

Wonders cost more to purchase than other types of products.
Cities can be directed to produce gold instead of other products.
A city producing gold will create one gold piece per turn for each production point it generates.
Some building types enhance production.
Building types that enhance production are Factory, Power Plant, Hydro Plant, Offshore Platform, Nuclear Plant, Manufacturing Plant.
Each city can have only one building that is a power plant.

By default, new cities start working on the best available defensive units.
When a city completes a unit, by default it starts working on another unit of the same type.
After completing a building or a wonder, by default a city starts working on a different type of building or wonder.

It is useful to classify your cities based on their terrain properties.
It is also useful to classify your cities based on how you intend to use them in your civilization.
Some cities might be built to provide defenses of your borders.
Some cities might be focused on research or on economic output.

Trade points come from commerce.
Some trade points are lost by corruption.
Corruption depends on the form of government.
Corruption in a city depends on its distance from the capital.

A city has trade points.
Each city uses its trade points for three things.
Trade points can be converted to player gold.
Trade points can be converted into luxury points.
Worker happiness can be improved by luxury points.
Trade points can be converted into science points.
Discovering a new technology consumes science points.
The conversion rates for trade points affect the entire civilization. 
The conversion rates depend on the form of government.
The civilization accumulates gold and science points.
Luxury points are only accumulated in the city that produces them.
The conversion rates represent an important tradeoff.
Three types of buildings directly affect trade.
Building a courthouse affects trade.
Building a palace affects trade.
Building a super highway affects trade.
Access to roads adds to a city's trade points.
Terrain with rare commodities adds to a city's trade points.  

Trade routes provide trade points.
A trade route is established as follows.
Produce a caravan or freight in the city.  
Send that unit to another city.
The city must either be at least eight squares away or belong to a different civilization.
The civilizations of the two cities must have an alliance.
Finally, give the make trade route command.
The city starting the trade route gets gold points and science points.
The revenue depends on the trade already produced by the two cities.
The revenue is higher when the cities are further apart.
The railroad or flight technologies lower the revenue.
Trade routes generate trade points for both cities every turn.
The trade points produced by the trade route depends on the trade points from the terrain worked by both cities.
Trade routes generate more if the cities are on different continents.
Trade routes generate more if the cities are from different civilizations.

A city can have four trade routes.
Attempting to establish a fifth trade route will cause the trade route with the smallest revenue to be eliminated.
