Cities need food every turn.
The food required in a city depends on the size of the city.
The size of a city is the number of its citizens.
The food required in a city depends on the number of citizens.
The food required in a city depends on the number of settlers.

The rate of food consumption of citizens is two food points per turn.
The rate of food consumption of settlers depends on the government.
Under anarchy, despotism, monarchy, and communism, the rate of food consumption of settlers is one food point per turn.
Under republic and democracy, the rate of food consumption of settlers is two points per turn.

Food production occurs within cities.
The rate of food production depends on the number of citizens working.
The rate of food production depends on the terrain being worked.
Most terrain produces less than two food points per turn.
Some terrain produces more food points because that terrain has special properties.
Irrigating a place increases food production.

Every city has a storage capacity.
If the rate of food production is greater than food required, storage occurs.
When storage occurs in a city, the amount of food stored increases. 
If the rate of food production is less than food required, the difference is drawn from food stored.
Starvation occurs if the food stored would become negative.
During starvation, settlers and citizens die until 
During starvation, settlers die first, followed by citizens, until the food stored would be zero.  

When the amount of food stored in a city becomes full, the population grows by one citizen.
This growth causes the amount of food stored in the city to become empty. 
Adding a granary in a city increases its growth rate.
With a granary in a city, the amount of food stored becomes half-full after growth.
The amount of food stored in a city needed to reach full depends on the population of the city.
This means that each new citizen is more costly than the last.
