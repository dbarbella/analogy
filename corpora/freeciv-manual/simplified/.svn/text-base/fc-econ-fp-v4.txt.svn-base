Cities need food every turn.
The food required in a city depends on the size of the city.
The size of a city is the number of its citizens.
The food required in a city depends on the number of citizens.
The food required in a city depends on the number of settlers.
The food required in a city depends on the city's total food consumption.
The food consumption of citizens is two food points per turn.
The food consumption of settlers depends on the government.
Under anarchy, despotism, monarchy, and communism, the food consumption of settlers one food point per turn.
Under republic and democracy, the food consumption of settlers is two points per turn.

Food production occurs within cities.
City food production depends on the number of citizens working.
The city food production depends on the terrain being worked.
Most terrain produces less than two food points per turn.
Some terrain produces more food points because that terrain has special properties.
Irrigating a tile increases food production.

Every city has a storage capacity.
If the city food production is greater than the food required in the city, a city accumulates food.
If the city's food production is less than the food required in the city, the city loses food.
Starvation occurs if the food stored would become negative.
During starvation, settlers die first, followed by citizens, until the food stored would be zero.  

When the amount of food stored in a city becomes full, the population grows by one citizen.
The growth causes the amount of food stored in the city to become empty. 
Building a granary in a city increases its growth rate.
With a granary in a city, the amount of food stored becomes half-full after growth.
The amount of food stored in a city needed to reach full depends on the population of the city.
This means that each new citizen is more costly than the last.
