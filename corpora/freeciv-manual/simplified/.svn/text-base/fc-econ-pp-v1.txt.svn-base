Every city produces at least one production point per turn.
Units in the city consume production points.
These units include military units, settlers, workers, and engineers.
Each unit in a city consumes one production point per turn.
Under some governments, a few units are supported for free.
If city production drops too low, the units that cannot be supported are disbanded.
Extra production points are consumed by the process of building a product.

Cities can build units, buildings, or wonders. 
When the amount of production points used in creating a product reaches the cost of the product, that product is complete.
Products appear in their city when complete.
Completed units appear on the map.
Completed buildings are added to the city's list of structures.
Completed wonders are added to the city's list of structures.
Any extra production points after something is completed are applied towards the next project.
Each city can have only one of each type of building.
 Some buildings require that another is built first.
Each wonder can only be completed by one civilization per game.
If you produce units or buildings that you cannot support, they will be disbanded immediately after completion.
Building a settler consumes one citizen, in addition to production points.
If a city builds a settler with its last citizen, that city will disband when the settler is completed.

The product a city is building can be changed on any turn.
The accumulated production points are used towards the new product.
Switching products during construction can be costly.
No points are lost in switching between different types of units, different types of buildings, or different wonders.
Otherwise, half of the accumulated production points are lost.

You can spend gold to complete a project in one turn.
The purchase cost of the product depends on the total production needed.
As the accumulated production of the city rises, the purchase cost of the product falls.

Wonders cost even more to purchase than other types of products.
Cities can be directed to produce gold instead of other products.
A city producing gold will create one gold piece per turn for each production point it generates.
Some building types enhance production.
Building types that enhance production are Factory, Power Plant, Hydro Plant, Offshore Platform, Nuclear Plant, Manufacturing Plant.
Each city can have only one building that is a power plant.

By default, new cities start working on the best available defensive units.
When a city completes a unit, by default it starts working on another unit of the same type.
After completing a building or a wonder, by default a city starts working on a different type of building or wonder.

It is useful to classify your cities based on their terrain properties.
It is also useful to classify your cities based on how you intend to use them in your civilization.
Some cities might be built to provide defenses of your borders.
Some cities might be focused on research or on economic output.
