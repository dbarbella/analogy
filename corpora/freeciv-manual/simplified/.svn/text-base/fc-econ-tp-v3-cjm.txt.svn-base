Trade points come from commerce.
Some trade points are lost by corruption.
Corruption depends on the form of government.
Corruption in a city depends on its distance from the capital.

A city has trade points.
Each city uses its trade points for three things.
Trade points can be converted to player gold.
Trade points can be converted into luxury points.
Worker happiness can be improved by luxury points.
Trade points can be converted into science points.
Discovering a new technology consumes science points.
The conversion rates for trade points affect the entire civilization. 
The conversion rates depend on the form of government.
The civilization accumulates gold and science points.
Luxury points are only accumulated in the city that produces them.
The conversion rates represent an important tradeoff.
Three types of buildings directly affect trade.
Building a courthouse affects trade.
Building a palace affects trade.
Building a super highway affects trade.
Access to roads adds to a city's trade points.
Terrain with rare commodities adds to a city's trade points.  

Trade routes provide trade points.
A trade route is established as follows.
Produce a caravan or freight in the city.  
Send that unit to another city.
The city must either be at least eight squares away or belong to a different civilization.
The civilizations of the two cities must have an alliance.
Finally, give the make trade route command.
The city starting the trade route gets gold points and science points.
The revenue depends on the trade already produced by the two cities.
The revenue is higher when the cities are further apart.
The railroad or flight technologies lower the revenue.
Trade routes generate trade points for both cities every turn.
The trade points produced by the trade route depends on the trade points from the terrain worked by both cities.
Trade routes generate more if the cities are on different continents.
Trade routes generate more if the cities are from different civilizations.

A city can have four trade routes.
Attempting to establish a fifth trade route will cause the trade route with the smallest revenue to be eliminated.
