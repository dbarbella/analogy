Cities are created when settlers are given the build city command.
Cities cannot be built on glaciers or oceans. 
The city's number of citizens equals the size of a city.  
The size of a city can reach dozens.  
Citizens can be killed by famine and by war.  
When the size of a city reaches zero, the city is destroyed.  

Each city can work terrain within the five by five grid centered on the city, minus its corners.  
Resources can be extracted from terrain by placing a citizen there.  
The square where a city is placed is always worked for resources. Terrain cannot be worked by two citizens at once.  

Terrain that is occupied by an enemy unit cannot be worked. 
This means you can conduct a siege by placing your units on terrain being worked by an enemy city. 
Units can be ordered to pillage, which destroys improvements.

Buildings can be added to cities. 
Different types of buildings have different effects on a city.  Each city can only have at most one building of a particular type.  
Some buildings require other buildings.  
Most buildings require achieving some technology before they can be constructed.  
Some buildings can be made obsolete when some technology is discovered.
	
Creating a building in a city costs production points. 
It can require multiple turns.  
Many buildings require gold points for upkeep.  
If you cannot pay the upkeep on all of your buildings, some of them will be automatically sold.  
Selling a building provides one gold piece for each production point used in building it.

Each type of wonder can only be constructed by one civilization per game. 
Civilizations often race to complete a desirable wonder.
While buildings affect only their on city, many wonders benefit their entire civilization.  
You can create a building in a city using the city's production points.  
By sending trade units to a city building a wonder, their entire cost can be used towards constructing the wonder.  

Each citizen plays one role at a time.  
A citizen can be a converted to a worker, assigned to a terrain tile around the city.
A citizen can be converted to an entertainer.  
Entertainers produce 2 luxury points per turn for their city.  
Two other roles become avaialble when the size of a city reaches five.  
A citizen can be converted to a tax collector.  
Tax collectors produce 3 gold per turn.  
A citizen can be converted to a scientist.  
Each scientist creates three science points per turn.

Each citizen is either happy, content, unhappy, or angry.  
The first four workers in a city are content by default.  
Workers beyond five are initially unhappy.  
A city falls into disorder when there are more unhappy workers than happy workers. 
A city in disorder generates no food, production, science, or taxes.  
Under disorder, a city still produces luxury points.  
Unhappy workers can revolt.  
In democracy, prolonged disorder can result in revolution.  Converting workers to entertainers, tax collectors, or scientists can avoid disorder.  
Some buildings and wonders can make workers content. This can help avoid disorder.

Cities with more than two citizens celebrate when half their citizens are happy workers and none are unhappy. 
When celebrating, under monarchy or communism terrain has a trade bonus.  
When celebrating under republic or democracy, the city enters a state of rapture.  
In rapture, a city grows by one citizen on each turn that has a food surplus.  
Rapture provides a rapid way to grow large cities.

For every to luxury points a city produces, one content worker is made happy.  
If there are no content workers, one unhappy worker becomes content.  
A city can also convert trade points to luxury points.  

Military units can affect city happiness.  
Under authoritarian governments military units stationed in a city prevent unhappiness. 
Under representative governments, military units can cause unhappiness when they are outside your national borders.
