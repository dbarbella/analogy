Units provide mobility and violence.
There are four types of units.  
Military units are used for defense and attack.  
Noncombatants are used for expanding a civilization.  
Diplomatic units are used for interacting with other civilizations. 
Trade units are used for economic purposes.  

Supporting units is a major expense.  
Each unit consumes 1 production point per turn.  
Settlers consume 1 or 2 food points per turn, depending on your form of government.  
Autocratic governments force cities to support several units for free.  
This saves production points for other purposes.

Under representative governments, aggressive units standing outside your borders each cause 1 or 2 workers to become unhappy.  
This makes war quite expensive under representative government, since luxury points must be produced to mollify the citizens as well as the production points needed to support the units.

A unit begins each turn with a number of movement points.
The number of movement points a unit has depends on the unit's mobility.
Movement points negatively depend on the damage of a unit.  
Movement points not consumed by the end of the turn are lost and cannot be stored or transferred.  
Building a lighthouse, Magellan's expedition, or nuclear power increases the movement points of sea units.
units consumes movement points when they act.  
Actions require at least one movement point.

Units can potentially move to any of the eight tiles that surround them. 
Land units are confined to land and transport vessels. 
Ships are confined to water and port cities.  
Aircraft ignore terrain. 
Aircraft need to end their turns in places where they can refuel.  
A unit consumes 1 movement point per action.
Regardless of damage, units can always move one square.  
Movement on rough terrain costs more movement points for land units.  
Land units disembarking from ships lose all remaining movement points.

Enemy units impose zones of control.  
A zone of control consists of the 8 squares surrounding a unit. 
Military units and noncombatants cannot move directly between two squares in a zone of control.  

Land units can move instantly from one airport to another in a friendly city with the airlift action.  
An airport can participate in only 1 airlift per turn.
