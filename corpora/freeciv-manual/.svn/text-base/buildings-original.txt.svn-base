Topic: Buildings and wonders

Cities may be enhanced with a wide variety of buildings, each with a different effect; each city may have only one of each building.
Buildings are listed and described here.
Some buildings require others — as when you must have a Marketplace before building a Bank.
Most buildings become available only when you achieve certain technologies, while technology makes others become obsolete.

It costs production points to construct buildings — often taking several turns — and, once completed, many buildings require an upkeep of several gold pieces. You may dismantle and sell a building, receiving one gold piece for each production point used in its construction.
If a turn comes on which you cannot pay the upkeep on all of your buildings, some of them will be automatically sold; obviously this should be avoided as the buildings chosen might not be ones you would have preferred to sell.

Wonders are unique structures that can each be constructed by only one civilization per game. Players often race to be the first to complete a coveted wonder. While buildings affect only their own city, many wonders benefit their entire civilization. And while buildings must be built using local production points, caravans and freight built in other cities can contribute their full cost in production points towards the construction of a wonder (simply disbanding units returns only half of their cost).
