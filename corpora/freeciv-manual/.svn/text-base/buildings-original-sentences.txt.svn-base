Buildings

Airport

An Airport allows a city to produce veteran air units (including helicopters). Also, damaged air units (including helicopters) which stay in town for one full turn without moving are completely restored. Two cities with Airports can airlift one unit per turn. Airlifting instantly transports the unit from one city to another and will use all of the unit's movement points. A unit must have some movement points left to be airlifted. 

Aqueduct

An Aqueduct allows a city to grow larger than size 8. A Sewer System is also required for a city to grow larger than size 12. 

Bank

Together with the Marketplace improvement, a Bank increases the luxury and tax production within a city by 100%.

Barracks

With a Barracks, each new land unit built in a city will automatically have Veteran status, which means that its attack and defence strengths are increased by 50%. Also, damaged land units which stay in town for one full turn without moving are completely restored. The discovery of Gunpowder will make Barracks obsolete. 

Barracks 2

With a Barracks 2, each new land unit built in a city will automatically have Veteran status, which means that its attack and defence strengths are increased by 50%. Also, damaged land units which stay in town for one full turn without moving are completely restored. The discovery of Mobile Warfare will make Barracks 2 obsolete. 

Barracks 3

With a Barracks 3, each new land unit built in a city will automatically have Veteran status, which means that its attack and defence strengths are increased by 50%. Also, damaged land units which stay in town for one full turn without moving are completely restored. 

Cathedral

A Cathedral makes 3 unhappy citizens content in a city, making it easier to maintain order in that city. The discovery of Theology increases the effect of a Cathedral, making an additional unhappy citizen content. The discovery of Communism lessens the effect of a Cathedral, reducing by one the number of unhappy citizens made content. 

City Walls

City Walls make it easier to defend a city. They triple the defence strength of units within the city against land and helicopter units. They are ineffective against airborne and sea units as well as Howitzers. City Walls also prevent the loss of population which occurs when a defending unit is destroyed by a land unit. 

Coastal Defense

Increases the defence strength of units within a city by a factor of 2 when defending against bombardments from enemy ships. 

Coinage

This is not a normal improvement. Instead, setting a city's production to Coinage means its shield production is converted to tax output, coins.

Colosseum

The Collosseum entertains the citizens of a city, making 3 unhappy citizens content. (Four after the discovery of Electricity.)

Courthouse
A Courthouse reduces the corruption and waste in a city by 50%. Under a Democracy, a Courthouse makes 1 unhappy citizen content. It also makes the revolt cost of the city 4 times bigger. 

Factory

Increases the shield production in a city by 50%. This increase may also contribute significantly to pollution. 

Granary

The amount of stored food will be set to half full whenever a city with a Granary shrinks or grows. This helps a city to grow faster and more easily withstand famine. 

Harbour

Gives one extra food resource on all Ocean tiles. The city needs to be coastal to build this improvement. 

Hydro Plant

Increases the effect of Factory and Mfg. Plant on the shield production of a city, and also reduces the amount of pollution generated by that production. A Hydro Plant in combination with either a Factory or Mfg. Plant gives a 75% production bonus over the level without any of these improvements, while giving pollution only 75% of the equivalent combination with a Power Plant; a Hydro Plant, Factory, and Mfg. Plant together give a 150% production bonus with pollution only 50% of the equivalent combination with a Power Plant. In each city, only one Power Plant, Hydro Plant, Nuclear Plant, or Solar Plant can take effect at any one time. A city can only build a Hydro Plant if it is next to (or on) a River tile. 

Library

The Library increases the science output in a city by 100%. 

Marketplace

The Marketplace increases the luxury and tax output in a city by 50%. 

Mass Transit

Neutralizes the pollution generated by the population. The population simply has no effect on the pollution generated in the city. 

Manufacturing Plant

Together with a Factory, a Manufacturing Plant increases the shield production in a city by 100%. 

Nuclear Plant

Increases the effect of Factory and Mfg. Plant on the shield production of a city, and also reduces the amount of pollution generated by that production. A Nuclear Plant in combination with either a Factory or Mfg. Plant gives a 75% production bonus over the level without any of these improvements, while giving pollution only 75% of the equivalent combination with a Power Plant; a Nuclear Plant, Factory, and Mfg. Plant together give a 150% production bonus with pollution only 50% of the equivalent combination with a Power Plant. In each city, only one Power Plant, Hydro Plant, Nuclear Plant, or Solar Plant can take effect at any one time. 

Offshore Platform

Adds 1 extra shield resource on all Ocean tiles worked by a city. The city needs to be coastal to build this improvement. 

Palace

Makes a city the capital and the center of your government. Corruption in other cities is related to how far away from the capital they are, except when the government is Democracy or Communism. The cost of inciting a revolt in a city also depends upon the city's distance from the capital (under all forms of government). 

Take good care of your capital, as its loss may result in your empire plunging into civil war. Losing your current palace also results in losing whatever spaceship you might have. 

Under Despotism the city containing the palace gains a +75% production bonus, and under Monarchy a +50% production bonus. 

Police Station

Reduces the unhappiness caused by aggressively deployed military units owned by the city by 2 under Democracy and 1 under Republic -- in other words, it neutralises the unhappiness caused by a single military unit. This improvement has no effect under other governments. 

Port Facility

Allows a city to build veteran sea units. Also, damaged sea units which stay in town for one full turn without moving are completely restored. 


Power Plant

Increases the effect of Factory and Manufacturing Plant on the shield production of a city. A Power Plant in combination with either a Factory or Mfg. Plant gives a 75% production bonus over the level without any of these improvements; a Power Plant, Factory, and Mfg. Plant together give a 150% production bonus. The extra production may lead to the city generating more pollution. In each city, only one Power Plant, Hydro Plant, Nuclear Plant, or Solar Plant can take effect at any one time. 

Recycling Center

Building a Recycling Center reduces the amount of pollution generated by production in a city by 66%. 

Research Lab

Together with a Library, a Research Lab increases the science production of a city by 200%. Together with a Library and a University, a Research Lab increases the science production of a city by 450%. 

SAM Battery

Doubles the defense of all units inside the city when attacked by aircraft (not including helicopters or missiles). 

SDI Defense

Protects a city and its environs (up to 2 tiles away) from attacks by Nuclear units. A Nuclear unit attacking a city with SDI Defense, or attacking a unit (or deliberately exploded) within range, is shot down and simply has no effect. Also, doubles defence for units in the city against non-nuclear missiles. 

Sewer System

Allows a city to grow larger than size 12. An Aqueduct is first required for a city to grow larger than size 8. 

Solar Plant

Increases the effect of Factory and Manufacturing Plant on the shield production of a city, and also greatly reduces the amount of pollution generated by that production. A Solar Plant in combination with either a Factory or Mfg. Plant gives a 75% production bonus over the level without any of these improvements, while giving pollution only 50% of the equivalent combination with a Power Plant; a Solar Plant, Factory, and Manufacturing Plant together give a 150% production bonus, and eliminates all pollution generated by production in that city. In each city, only one Power Plant, Hydro Plant, Nuclear Plant, or Solar Plant can take effect at any one time. 

Space Component

Space Components can be differentiated into Propulsion and Fuel Components. Each pair of them reduces your spaceship's travel time. You can build up to 8 pairs. Before you can build any spaceship parts, the Apollo Program wonder must have been built by any player, and a factory in the city ordering the Component. 

Space Module

Space Modules are the most expensive parts of spaceships. There are three different types of Space Module: Habitation Module, Life Support Module, and Solar Panels.  The Habitation Module provides living space for 10,000 people. The Life Support Module: provides food and water for the population of one Habitation Module. The Solar Panels provides the energy needed for any two of the other Modules. You can build up to 4 Space Modules of each kind. 
Before you can build any spaceship parts, the Apollo Program wonder must have been built by any player, and a factory in the city ordering the Module. 

Space Structural

Space Structurals form the base of your spaceship. All other spaceship parts need to be connected to Structurals in order to function. You can build up to 32 Space Structurals. Before you can build any spaceship parts, the Apollo Program wonder must have been built by any player, and a factory in the city ordering the Structural. 

Stock Exchange

Together with a Bank, a Stock Exchange boosts tax and luxury production in a city by 50%. Together with a Marketplace and a Bank, a Stock Exchange boosts tax and luxury production in a city by 150%. 

Super Highway

Increases trade resources by 50% on all tiles with roads or railroads. 

Supermarket

Increases the food resources by 50% on each farmland tile which is being used around the city. Farmland squares are those which have been irrigated a second time. 

Temple

Makes one unhappy citizen content. Both the Mysticism advance and the Oracle wonder double this effect. With both Mysticism and the Oracle, 4 citizens are made content. 

University

Together with a Library, a University increases the science production of a city by 250%.
