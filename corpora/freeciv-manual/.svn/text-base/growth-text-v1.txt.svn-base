There is a type of quantity called "production points".
There is a type of quantity called "production progress".
There is a type of quantity called "luxury points".
There is a type of quantity called "gold".

Every city has food points.
Every city has production points.
Every city has luxury points.
Every player has gold.

There is a type of process called "eating".
Eating is done by citizens of a city.
Eating consumes food points of the city.  

Famine occurs when a city has less food points than its population needs on a turn.
Famine causes the population of a city to decrease.

Supporting a unit is done by a city.
Supporting a unit costs  production points.

Production is a process.
Production is done by a city.
Production results in some product.
Production can take multiple turns to complete.
Production accumulates excess production points of a city.
When production progress equals the cost of the product, the process is finished.

Corruption is a process.
Corruption consumes some of the trade points of a city.
The degree of corruption depends on the distance to the capital city.
The degree of corruption depends on the type of government.

Working is a process.
Working occurs when a worker is placed on a tile.
What is produced when working a tile depends on the tile.
Working a tile can produce trade points.
Working a tile can produce food points.
Working a tile can produce production points.

Citizens can be assigned to different jobs.
One type of job is called "worker".
One type of job is called "entertainer".
One type of job is called "tax collector".
One type of job is called "scientist".

Every citizen is either happy, content, unhappy, or angry.
Entertainers, tax collectors, and scientists are always content.
Each citizen eats  two food points per turn.
Each settler eats food points each turn.

Terrain is organized into units called "tiles".
Some tiles produce food points.
Some tiles produce production points.
Some tiles produce trade points.
Putting a citizen of a city to work on a tile causes points to be added to that city.
Cities consist of two spatial regions.
One spatial region is the tile that the city is on.
There is a type of spatial region called "working land".
The working land of a city is a five by five square, centered on the city, minus the corners.

Tiles can be improved.
A land tile can be irrigated to produce more food.
Irrigation requires that an adjacent tile must be a water source.
A water source can be a river, an ocean, or another irrigated tile.
A mine can be build on a land tile to yield more production points.
Irrigating a tile with a mine causes the mine to be destroyed.
Building a mine on an irrigated tile undoes the irrigation.
Building a road on a tile can improve trade on it.
Building a railroad on a tile can increase production on it.

Some tiles contain special resources.
Tiles containing special resources provide more output when worked.

The city tile is always worked.  
The city tile automatically gets a road when roads are available.
The city tile automatically gets a railroad when they are available.
If the city has a supermarket, its tile gets the food bonus associated with farmland.
Workers cannot be placed on a tile that a neighboring city is already working on.
Workers cannot be placed on tiles where an enemy unit is.
Workers cannot be placed on tiles that lie inside another player's borders.
Only one worker can be placed on a tile.

A siege is a hostile act where one player reduces the productivity of another player's city by placing units so that tiles cannot be worked.
A siege of a city can cause famine or economic problems in it.

There is a hostile act called "pillage".
Pillaging destroys improvements to tiles around a city.
Pillaging requires moving a combat unit to the working land of a city.

A city will always be trying to produce something.
Production points generated by a city each turn are first used to support units.  
If city production drops too low, units that cannot be supported are destroyed.
Any leftover production points are applied towards whatever the city is currently producing.

Cities can produce coinage.
When producing coinage, a city creates one gold piece per turn for each production point.  
Coinage is finished each turn.

Cities can produce units.
Cities can produce buildings.
Cities can produce wonders.

Workers produce some amount of food points, production points, and trade points every turn.
How much each worker produces depends on which tiles the workers are on.
Each entertainer provides two luxury points per turn for their city.
Each tax collector provides three gold per turn for the player.
Each scientist adds three points to research output.

Food points produced each turn are added to the food points of the city.
Food points consumed by the citizens of the city each turn.  Once the number of food points of a city reaches its food point capacity, the city grows by one citizen.  When a city grows, its food point capacity increases.

The trade points generated by a city each turn are distributed between gold, luxury points, and science points.

Building a settler consumes one citizen.

A city can be in disorder.
When a city is in disorder, no taxes are collected.
When a city is in disorder, production stops.
When a city is in disorder, it stops contributing to research.
When a city is in disorder, it can revolt.

For every two luxury points a city produces, one content worker becomes happy.
If there are no content workers, one unhappy worker becomes content.
Turning angry citizens into unhappy citizens costs two luxury points.
All angry citizens must be turned into unhappy citizens before any unhappy citizens can become content.
There are two sources of luxury points.
One source of luxury points are entertainers.
Another source of luxury points is trade.

Building buildings in a city can improve its  production.
Only one building of each type can be built in a city.

Building a building costs production points.  
There is a continuous process called "upkeep".
Upkeep of a building can cost gold each turn.
If there is not enough gold for upkeep, a building will be sold at random.
Selling  a building provides one gold for each production point used in its construction.
Caravans can contribute all of the production points used in building them towards the construction in another city.

Some buildings improve food production.
