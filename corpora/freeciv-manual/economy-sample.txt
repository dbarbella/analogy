Trade reflects wealth generated in each city by external commerce.
Some trade points may be lost to corruption, which varies among forms of government and increases with distance from your capital city.
Each city distributes its remaining trade points among three uses.
One is gold, in the form of taxes, which goes into your national treasury.
Another are luxury points, which influence worker morale.
Third, science points contribute towards the discovery of new technology.
