I. INTRODUCTION AND ECONOMICS
The sun has been giving energy to the earth for millions of years. Sunlight shining down on plants eons ago was the major cause of the coal, oil, and natural gas we use as fuels today. These fuels are called fossil fuels because they are the products of fossils of dead plants.
A similar source of solar energy used today is called biomass; this term refers to the use of the sun's energy to grow plants which can be used for fuels and other purposes. For example, wood used in fireplaces is a form of biomass solar energy. Researchers are working on other ways to grow plants for use as energy. Seaweed is being grown and harvested for  methane production (a gas-like natural gas), and trees are being grown for use in power plants to generate electricity.
The sun also has a major impact on wind and ocean currents. Different parts of the earth's surface are heated differently by the sun, causing circulating currents in both the oceans and the atmosphere. Ocean currents are rivers of cold or warm water which can be tapped to run power plants; someday, these currents may be used to produce electricity. Winds have been used for centuries to power pumps and to grind grain.
The sun's radiation may also be used directly to provide either electricity or heat; it is used directly as it comes raining down through the atmosphere rather than indirectly by making plants grow or causing wind or ocean currents.
Solar cells convert sunlight directly to electricity. These cells are usually made of silicon (a mineral used in the transistors which run radios and pocket calculators). Many of the space satellites circling the earth today are powered by solar cells. Since solar cells are very expensive in terms of the amount of electricity they provide, their use to date has been mostly to provide power for remote weather stations where the cost of bringing in power lines would be prohibitive; another application has been in powering remote railroad-crossing lights and ocean buoys.
Heating is the other example of direct use of the sun. You've probably experienced the heating effects of solar energy when walking barefoot on a tarred road on a hot, sunny day. The heat produced by solar energy can be used to power turbines to generate electricity, or it can be used to heat buildings or water. One system now being developed to generate electricity uses hundreds of mirrors which focus the sun's rays on a central tower; a boiler on the tower gets very hot and produces steam, driving a turbine that generates electricity. Although the sun's position changes from morning to evening, the mirrors move to let the sun's reflection focus on the tower. Systems like these are called tracking because they follow the sun from sunrise to sundown.
Even if a solar energy system isn't designed to follow the sun, the sun's heat can still be captured. Solar heating systems which aren't of the tracking kind are called flat-plate systems. In comparison to tracking systems, they are not very sophisticated, but almost all of the solar energy systems in use today are of the flat-plate variety. Over a million flat-plate systems are now in operation, mostly in countries with hot, sunny climates such as Israel and Australia. The most common use for such systems is to heat water, but it is also practical to use them to warm a house in winter. Since flat-plate systems are the simplest and most widely used methods of using solar energy today, we will investigate them in detail. But first it is important to understand why solar energy has just recently begun to be a practical means of providing direct heating.
If sunlight is free, why hasn't solar energy been used before to heat houses and produce electricity? The following example will help you understand why. Let's suppose you owned a gold mine that contained only very low-grade gold ore. You would have to do a lot of digging before you got even a little gold. If you bought some expensive mining equipment, you could process much more of the low-grade ore and get more gold. Thus, even though the gold itself is free, it would be very costly to get very much of it out of the mine. You would have to balance the cost of the mining equipment against how much money you'd get when you sold your gold. If the gold were very valuable and the mining equipment relatively cheap, it might be worthwhile to dig up the gold. But if the equipment were expensive and the gold not very valuable, you'd be better off to leave it in the ground. Many gold mines in Utah that have only low-grade ore were closed down years ago; some have recently reopened because the price of gold has increased enough to make mining it worthwhile.
Solar energy is like the low-grade ore. The sun's rays must be mined, or collected, and then transformed into useful heat or electricity before they are worth anything. A solar energy system helps you get free solar energy, just as the mining equipment helps you get free gold. But, like mining equipment, a solar energy system can be very expensive-perhaps  more than the sun's energy is worth.
If conventional energy is expensive-that is, if the cost of heating by using fossil fuels and electricity goes up-then it might be worth the expense to install a solar energy system. But if these forms of energy are cheap, then the cost of installing a solar energy system would probably be too expensive. Simply put, the cost of the solar energy would come to more than the value of the energy it could collect from the sun. Just as many gold mines in Utah were shut down when it became too costly to mine their gold, many solar hot-water heaters used in Florida and California during the 1950s were shut down when the cost of electricity was so cheap. Recently the cost of heating by gas, oil, and electricity has risen so much that solar energy systems are once again worthwhile, much as the Utah gold mines have once again become profitable because of the rise in the price of gold.
A solar energy system can be thought of as mining sunlight. If mining equipment is simple and rugged, it will give many years of service before it must be replaced. But mining equipment can't be too expensive or it will make mining low-grade ore unprofitable. Like mining equipment, solar energy systems must be simple, rugged, and low in cost so that they will give many years of service without making the sunlight that they mine unprofitable. This is why the flat-plate collector solar system is being used so much today in countries such as Japan, Israel, and Australia: It is a very simple, rugged system whose cost is low enough to make the use of solar energy worthwhile.

2. HEAT, TEMPERATURE, AND HEAT FLOW
The concepts of heat and temperature must be understood before a solar energy system can be understood. Often these two terms are misunderstood and, even worse, used interchangeably. However, these words have quite precise meanings.
Heat and temperature differ in important ways. First, temperature can be measured directly with a thermometer, but heat must usually be measured indirectly. How hot something is, is a measure of its temperature, but how much heat it contains is not so easily determined. In fact, the heat contained in an object usually depends not only on what it's temperature is but also on other factors, such as what it is made of and how much of it there is.
Heat and temperature differ in another important way: heat costs money. When you heat your house for the winter, you buy heat from the local heat dealer--from the oil man or the gas or electric company, depending on how your house is heated. Whatever form your heat comes in, what is sent to your house costs money. The more heat that is sent, the higher the heating bills are. But you don't buy temperature. Temperature indicates how hot your house is, not how big your heating bills are. When considering solar energy systems in the pages that follow, always remember that what is wanted is heat, not temperature. The only way to save money by using a solar energy system is to have the sun pay for part of your heating bill-to provide you with heat.
A simple analogy to the heat and temperature of an object is the volume and depth of water in a cup. How deep the water is does not measure the cup's volume. Although the volume and the depth are related-generally, the deeper the water in the cup is, the more volume of water there is in it-depth is a different measure from volume. Also, the depth of the water can be  measured with a ruler, but a measuring cup must be used to ascertain the volume. According to our analogy, depth and temperature are easily measured, so they are like each other; volume and heat are measured only indirectly, so they are like each other too.
To see in more detail how depth is related to temperature, and volume to heat, let's consider a few simple cases. First, think of two different-sized cans that have the same depth of water in them. Though the depth of water in both cans is the same, the bigger can holds more volume. Similarly, if two pans of dirt are heated in an oven for several hours, both will have the same temperature. But even though the temperature of both pans is the same, the bigger pan holds more heat. Just as the depth can be the same while the volume is different, so can the temperature be the same while the heat is different.
Second, let's consider two objects in which the heat is the same yet the temperatures differ. Two warm bricks could contain the same amount of heat as one hot brick; though the hot brick naturally has a higher temperature than the warm ones. In the same way, two cans can hold the same volume but have  different depths.
The analogy is helpful in another way. Both volume and heat flow-both can move from place to place. When you pour water out of a pitcher into a glass, volume flows from the pitcher to the glass; when you open a door on a cold day, heat flows from inside the house to the outdoors.
Why does heat flow? Heat flows from one place to another because the temperature of the two places is different. A hot brick loses heat to a cool room. The temperature difference-the brick's temperature minus the room's temperature-drives the heat from the brick. Heat leaks from the brick until the temperature difference is gone. No more heat flows from the brick when it becomes as cool as the room it is in.
Similarly, a full can of water will leak volume from a hole in the side of the can. The depth of the water is higher than the depth of the hole, so the depth difference drives volume out through the hole. Eventually, all the volume that can leak out does so. When this happens, the water depth has fallen so that it is the same as that of the hole. There is no more depth difference, so no more volume flows out through the hole. Just as a difference in temperature causes heat to flow, so a difference in depth causes volume to flow. When there is no temperature difference, heat flow ceases; when there is no depth difference, volume flow ceases.
The direction of volume flow is always downhill--from a higher depth to a lower one. If two cans having different depths are connected by a tube, volume will always flow toward the depth that is lower. Note that the narrow can has much less volume than the wide one. Even so, volume flows toward the can with the lower depth. It's depth, not volume, that causes volume to flow.
Similarly, heat flows downhill from a higher temperature to a lower one. If a small, hot stone is put into a big pan of warm water, heat will flow out of the stone and into the water, since the stone is hotter than the water. Heat flow is always toward the object with the lower temperature-in this case, the water. Even though the big pan of water has much more heat than the hot little stone, heat still flows from the stone into the water. It's the temperature that makes the heat flow, not the amount of heat each object has.
Just as volume flows downhill toward lower depths, so heat flows downhill toward lower temperatures. Only a depth difference (not volume) can cause volume to flow, just as only a temperature difference (not heat) can cause heat to flow.
You may think it strange that heat flow is the same at cold temperatures as at hot temperatures. But consider this example. Suppose we took a frozen chicken out of the freezing compartment of a refrigerator and put it into the main part of the refrigerator. The chicken would warm up-heat would flow into it-even though it was in a cold refrigerator. Since the chicken started out colder than the refrigerator, heat had to flow into it to get it to be as warm as the refrigerator. If we then put the chicken into a hot oven, more heat would flow into it until it became as hot as the oven. In this example, heat flow depends only on the temperature difference between the chicken and its surroundings, not on whether the surroundings are hot or cold.
By analogy, the same volume flows from a hole in a can whether the can is on the floor or a table. Only the depth difference between the water level and the hole is important, not whether the can itself is raised or lowered.

************************************************************************
3. THERMAL RESISTANCE
Temperature differences are what cause heat to flow: heat flows from hot things to cold things. But other factors determine how fast the heat will flow. These other factors, when lumped together, cause a thermal resistance. The bigger the thermal resistance, the harder it is for heat to flow, since the resistance to the flow of heat is increased. Resistance is common to other forms of flow as well: electrical resistance restricts the flow of electric current, and fluid resistance restricts the flow of volume.
Fluid resistance might be thought of in terms of the size of a hole in the side of a container: a little hole has more fluid resistance than a big hole. The little hole doesn't let much volume out, but a big hole will, even though both holes are at the same depth. The little hole resists the flow of volume through it more than the big hole, so it has a high resistance.
Similarly, thermal resistance is a measure of how hard it is for heat to flow. Sometimes we say one house is better  insulated than another house, and that's exactly what thermal resistance is-how well insulated something is. Since a  well-insulated house has a higher thermal resistance than a poorly insulated one, the well-insulated one loses less heat than the poorly insulated one. The temperature difference may be the same for both houses (room temperature inside and cold out. doors), yet heat will leak at a slower rate from the one with high thermal resistance-the well-insulated one.
The extent of thermal resistance is caused by several factors, depending on the way heat moves from place to place. There are four important types of thermal resistance, corresponding  to each of the four important ways in which heat moves in solar heating systems. They are:
1. conduction 2. convection 3. radiation 4. transport
Before we look at each of these types of heat flow in detail, first let's see how they differ generally. As we have learned, heat is like water in that it flows from place to place. If it flows through material that isn't moving, the heat flows by means of conduction heat transfer. For instance, a silver spoon is hot when you've been stirring coffee because heat flows easily through the silver from the hot coffee to your fingers. The silver itself doesn't move, but heat flows through it. When we show conduction we'll always use a straight arrowto distinguish  it from the other ways in which heat flows.
In convection heat flow, a surface heats a liquid or gas near it, and the heat is carried away by the liquid or gas. For example, you feel cold on a windy day because the wind carries heat away from your skin by convection heat transfer. We'll use a curved arrow to show convection heat flow.
Radiation heat flow is a special kind of energy that travels like radio waves through air-and even through a vacuum. You feel warm in front of a fireplace mostly because the flames and hot coals move heat to your skin by radiation. Wavy arrows will be used to show heat flowing by means of radiation.
Transport heat flow is similar to convection in that it involves the transport of a heated liquid or gas. But instead of a surface heating the liquid or gas, previously heated liquid or gas is transported, or moved, from one place to another. Hot gases rising out of a chimney is a form of transport heat flow. We'll use a curlicue arrow to indicate transport heat flow.
Now that you have an idea of the ways heat flows in general, let's take a more detailed look at each way.

************************************************************************
4. CONDUCTION AND CONVECTION
First, let's look at conduction. Two kinds of materials are involved in conduction heat flow: conductors and insulators. Conductors let heat flow through them easily, but insulators prevent heat from flowing. Most metals, such as silver, copper, aluminum, and steel, are good conductors of heat. Insulators, on the other hand, are usually lightweight materials, such as straw, fiberglass batting, or plastic foam. Other materials, such as glass, concrete, rubber, wood, and dirt, are neither good conductors nor good insulators; heat passes through them more easily than through an insulator but not as easily as through a conductor.
Conduction heat flow depends on several factors. We've already learned that it depends in the first place on temperature difference (as does all heat flow) as well as on the kind of material involved (whether conductor or insulator). It also depends on the area of the heat-flow path. In the example of the silver spoon, the heat-flow path is from the coffee to the spoon's end.
To understand how the heat-flow path changes the conduction heat flow through an object, suppose we try to melt an ice cube using a cup of hot coffee. If we put one end of a silver bar into a coffee cup and hold an ice cube against the other end, the ice will hold one end of the bar at a fixed temperature (since ice melts at 32 F); how quickly the ice melts will measure how much heat is flowing through the bar from the coffee. A thick bar will melt the ice more quickly than a thin one because a thick bar lets more heat from the coffee through-the heat-flow path of the thicker bar has a bigger area.
The length of the heat-flow path is also important. Less heat flows through a longer bar than through a shorter bar because the length of the heat-flow path impedes the flow of heat.
Four factors affect how much heat will flow through a material by conduction: temperature difference, material, area, and the length of the heat-flow path. By analogy to water flow, think of a pipe attached to the bottom of a big tank.
Four factors also affect how much fluid will flow through the pipe. As shown in the following figure, lots of volume will flow out of a tank of water through a short, fat pipe. But depth difference affects the volume flow: if the tank isn't full, less will flow out. Second, the material also has an effect. Less volume flows if the tank is filled with honey than if it's filled with water. Third, flow-path area affects volume flow; there is less flow through a thin pipe than a fat one. Fourth, the length of the flow path is important, since less water flows through a long pipe than through a short one.
Now let's discuss convection. Heat flow by convection occurs when a gas such as air or a liquid such as water flows by a surface. In the example used earlier, the surface was your skin as air blew by it. As with conduction heat flow, convection heat flow depends on several factors. One factor, we've already learned, is temperature difference. In convection heat flow, it's the temperature difference between the surface and the convecting gas or liquid that's important. Other important factors are:
1. the area of the surface 2. the speed of the air or water over the surface 3. whether it's gas or liquid that flows by the surface.
The larger the surface area is, the more convection heat is lost from the surface. If you have the same amount of soup in a bowl as in a mug, the bowl will cool faster than the mug because its surface area is larger than the mug's. Second, the speed at which the convection gas or liquid flows by the surface influences how quickly the heat flows. Suppose two bricks are placed in an oven, heated to the same temperature, and then taken out. One is placed on a table in still air; the other is placed in front of a fan. The one sitting in still air would cool much more slowly than the one sitting In front of a fan. You might think that the brick in still air wouldn't have any air flowing by it at all. Actually, air is flowing by-but much more slowly than if the fan were blowing air by it. The brick heats the air near it, which gets lighter and rises and is replaced by cooler air, which in turn is warmed and rises. This phenomenon is called natural convection, since no fan is needed to cause the air to move: the air rises past the surface simply because the surface is hot.
Smoke rising from a cigarette illustrates how natural convection removes heat from burning tobacco; the smoke moves with the air, showing how a hot object causes air to move by it. Conversely, cold surfaces also cause convection, but in the opposite direction. Convection currents fall from a cold object, as you may have noticed when opening the freezer door to the refrigerator.
The last factor that is important in convection heat flow is whether a gas or a liquid is involved. Liquids are much better than gases at causing heat to flow from a surface. Eggs cook in a few minutes in boiling water, but they would take many times longer to cook in an oven at the same temperature. The eggs gain heat slowly by air-a gas-convecting over them, but they heat up quickly when water-a liquid-is convecting over them.
In summary, convection heat flows fastest when there are big temperature differences of large surfaces with liquid flowing by them quickly. Little convection heat flows with small temperature differences of small surfaces In still air.

************************************************************************
5. RADIATION AND TRANSPORT
Radiation heat flow is very similar to convection heat flow in many ways. Radiation heat flows from surfaces, as does convection heat flow. Radiation is also similar to convection in another basic way: the bigger the surface is, the more heat flows from the surface. Most surfaces lose heat by both radiation and convection, and it's sometimes hard to separate the two kinds of heat flow. For instance, the example used to illustrate convection- a cooling bowl and a cooling mug of soup-applies equally to radiation. The bowl loses heat quickly by both convection and radiation because the bowl has a bigger surface area. Some of the heat flow from both the bowl and the mug takes place by means of convection, and some by radiation.
However, radiation differs significantly from convection, especially with regard to solar energy. One big difference is that convection depends on a liquid or gas flowing by the surface. With radiation heat flow, the heat leaves the surface even if there is no gas or liquid around. In the vacuum of space, where no gas or liquid exists, heat flows from a space satellite only by radiation. Radiation heat flow is often called infrared radiation. Infrared film, for example, is sensitive to radiation heat flow; it is used to photograph heat leaving objects by radiation. We'll learn more about radiation heat flow when we discuss solar radiation- a kind of radiation heat flow that comes from the sun.
A second important difference between radiation and convection is that radiation heat flows from a surface in straight lines. If you put your hand to the side of a heating coil on an electric range, you would feel the warmth of the radiation heat flow. But if you put a book or even a piece of paper between the coil and your hand, it would block the radiation heat flow. Likewise, if you're sitting in front of a fire, the radiation heat flow from the embers is blocked if someone sits in front of you.
As with all heat flow, radiation heat flow depends on temperature difference. The important temperature difference is that which the surface sees. In the case of the bowl, the soup's surface sees the temperature of its surroundings (the room), so the important temperature difference is that between the soup and the room. In the case of the hand, the skin's surface sees the coil, so the important temperature difference is that between the skin and the coil.
Shiny surfaces play a role in radiation heat flow because they reflect radiation. For example, a thermos bottle is silvered to reflect back any heat that the hot soup inside might lose by radiation. This trick keeps the soup hot longer. Fiberglass batting used to insulate houses also has a shiny reflecting surface to keep heat in.
Radiation heat flow, then, is much like convection in one way: heat flows from surfaces at a rate depending on the size of the surface. But unlike convection, radiation heat flow travels in straight lines and can be very easily blocked from flowing. In addition, radiation heat flow can be affected by how shiny the surface is, whereas convection cannot.
Finally, let's discuss transport heat flow. Heat flow via a flowing gas or liquid is somewhat different from conduction, convection, and radiation. Suppose you wanted to heat up a cup of coffee by adding more hot coffee to it. When you add the coffee you're also adding heat, since the hot coffee has heat stored in it. Heat is physically transported from the pot to the cup by transferring a certain amount of hot coffee from the pot to the cup.
In most transport heat flow, the flowing gas or liquid moves continuously, not just for a short time, as in the example of the coffee and cup. To understand this, think again of the example of a house losing heat through its chimney. In this case, the flowing medium which transports the heat is a gas-mostly hot air. But for as much hot air that goes up the chimney, there must be as much cold air that comes in from outside to replace it. The cold air isn't so obvious because it leaks in through cracks in the walls, windows, and doors. Nevertheless, as much cold air leaks in as hot air leaves. The air, then, moves continuously: it enters in through the cracks, is heated by the fire, and flows out through the chimney. As in conduction, convection, and radiation, the amount of heat flow depends on the temperature difference. In this case, the important temperature difference is that between the incoming airflow and the outgoing airflow-the temperature of the hot air going out the chimney minus that of the cold air leaking in through the cracks in the house.
Transport heat flow depends on two other factors besides temperature difference. One is how fast the gas or liquid is flowing, and the other is what the flowing medium is. To better understand the first factor, suppose your house were heated by hot-water radiators. Hot water flows in one end and out the other end; how fast it flows depends on how wide you open the valve. To get lots of heat out of the radiator, you open the valve so that lots of hot water will flow through the radiator. If you don't want much heat, you close the valve so that little hot water will flow into the radiator; it, in turn, will add little heat to the room.
The second factor in transport heat flow is the flowing medium itself. Air and water are the two most important heat transfer mediums used in solar heating systems today. The key difference is the volume needed. In this respect, water is a much better heat transfer medium than air. More than a thousand times more air than water is needed to transport the same amount of heat. Fans are often used to transport heated air, while heated water is generally moved by pumps.

************************************************************************
6. THERMAL STORAGE
In solar energy heating systems, it's not enough to simply capture the sun's heat-it must also be stored. While heating a house during the day is useful, the house needs heat at night as well. Heat collected during the day must be stored until night. How is heat stored?
Storing heat is analogous to storing volume. If a cylindrical tank is filled with water, the amount that it holds-the volume stored-depends on how high its depth is. Similarly, the heat stored in a substance depends on how high its temperature is; a hot brick stores more heat than a warm one.
If a solar-heated house is to be kept at 70 F during the winter, heat stored at 50 F isn't useful. Only if the temperature of the storage material is above 70 F can the stored heat be used to warm the house. Thus, useful heat in terms of room heating is heat that is stored in a substance that is hotter than the room's temperature. By analogy, the useful water in a tank is the water stored above the outlet. Once the depth drops below the outlet, the remaining volume won't flow out, so it's not useful.
The amount of heat stored also depends on how much material is heated. The more storage material there is, the more heat can be stored at the same temperature above room temperature. Similarly, a bigger tank holds more volume than a smaller tank when both are of the same depth.
Often the amount of material is measured by volume. Using volume as a basis of measurement, different materials can be compared as to how well they store heat. In solar heating systems, heat is usually stored in water or crushed rock. Water stores heat somewhat better than does rock. A container of water can store two to three times the heat as the same-sized container filled with crushed rock.
Some materials store heat very poorly. Air, for example, stores almost no heat. A container of air stores one-thousandth the amount of heat as the same-sized container of water does.
To understand heat storage, consider the following example. When you turn off your furnace on a cold day, your house doesn't get cold immediately because heat is stored in the walls, the floor, and the furniture (very little is stored in the air). The stored heat leaks out slowly and keeps you warm for a short time even when the furnace is off. Adobe houses in the Southwest have very thick walls that store the day's heat well into the night.
Another form of heat storage is called latent heat storage. Instead of storing heat simply by getting hotter, some materials store heat by melting. Ordinary wax is such a material. Let's take a piece of solid wax. As we heat it, it gets hotter as does any other material. But when it gets so hot that it begins to melt a curious thing happens: even though we continue to add heat to the wax, It doesn't get any hotter. All the heat goes into melting the wax, and it stays at nearly the same temperature until all the wax is melted. Melted or liquid wax again acts like any other material-the more heat added, the hotter it gets.
When melted wax loses heat, its temperature naturally drops. But when it begins to solidify again it stops getting cooler. As it solidifies, it gives back all the extra heat-the latent heat-that was put into it when it was melted. While the wax is solidifying, its temperature remains nearly constant. Once it has completely hardened, it once again behaves like any other material, dropping in temperature as it gives up heat.
Suppose we use wax to store heat. As the wax melts, heat will be stored. Later, if we want the stored heat, we'd let the wax solidify again, giving up its latent heat. Materials like wax are called phase change material because they store heat by changing phase-that is, by melting or solidifying.
Why would you go to the trouble to use wax to store heat rather than water or crushed rocks? Because wax and other phase change materials can store a lot of heat. Wax can store several times the amount of heat of an equal volume of water and many times the heat of an equal volume of crushed rock. Wax itself is fairly expensive to use to store heat. Other phase change materials are cheaper and don't pose a fire hazard that wax might.
The water analogy to a phase change material is a tank that has a bulge in its sides. When the water depth is below the bulge, adding volume only increases the depth, as it would in any other tank. But when the depth reaches the bulge, a lot more volume is needed to raise the depth. Extra volume is stored in the bulge just as extra heat is stored in the wax when it melts. If the tank is drained the extra volume can be recovered, just as the latent heat in the wax can be recovered when it solidifies. When the water depth in a tank is at the level of the bulge, volume can be added or taken away without changing the depth much. Similarly, when wax is near its melting temperature, heat can be added or taken away without changing the wax's temperature much.

7. HOUSE HEATING
We know that heat can be transferred by several different methods and that heat can also be stored. Let's see how all the different types of heat flow and storage combine together in a familiar application. Later, when we talk about solar heating systems, one important use will be in heating a house: the solar heating system will add heat and the house will lose heat. The heating losses of a house provide a good example of the way heat can flow by several methods at the same time.
Before we can talk about house heat losses, we have to understand house heating. A house's heating system-whether it is gas, oil, electric, or even solar-tries to keep the house at a more or less fixed temperature. When the house gets too cold the furnace comes on and adds heat to the inside of the house. The heat might be added by means of baseboard electric heaters, a gas-burning hot-air system, an oil-fired water furnace delivering heat through baseboard radiators, or any number of other heating systems. The added heat, by whatever system, tends to heat the rooms-to increase their temperature. Once the indoors temperature gets a little hotter, the thermostat sends a signal to the furnace and it turns off.
Once the furnace turns off, the house slowly loses heat to the outdoors. It doesn't lose heat right away, because heat is stored for a time in the walls and floors. When the thermostat senses that the house has become too cold, it turns the furnace on again and the cycle repeats. You usually don't notice these changes in temperature in the house because they are so small. For example, if you set your thermostat at 70 F, the furnace might turn on when it cooled to 68 F and turn off again when it reached 72 F. Room temperature is always moving slightly up and down-getting hotter and colder-but it always remains very close to the set temperature.
Now, remember the water analogy to heat and temperature. The temperature of an object is equivalent to the water depth of a tank; the heat is equivalent to the volume of water; and the heat flow is equivalent to the water flow. How could we make the water equivalent of a house-heating system? Suppose we let water pour from a faucet into a bucket that has small holes in its bottom. The faucet is equivalent to a house's furnace because the faucet adds water to the bucket just as a furnace adds heat to a house. The holes in the bucket represent the way the heat leaks from the house. When the faucet adds water to the bucket, it leaks out through the holes; when the furnace adds heat to the house, it leaks out through the walls, doors, windows, roof, and cellar.
The depth of water in the bucket is equivalent to the room temperature in the house. While the temperature difference is what drives the heat from the house, the depth difference is what drives the water from the bucket. The depth difference is simply the depth of water in the bucket, since the holes are at the bucket's bottom. The bottom of the bucket is equivalent to the outdoors temperature.
Just as the thermostat keeps the house's temperature relatively stable, you could keep the depth of the water in the bucket relatively constant. Suppose you were to draw a line on the bucket indicating the depth you wanted to hold. If the depth dropped below the line, you'd turn on the faucet. Similarly, when a thermostat senses that the house is getting a little too cold, it turns on the furnace. The faucet adds water to the bucket just as the furnace adds heat to the house. When the depth went higher than the line on the bucket, you'd turn off the faucet. Likewise, when the thermostat senses that the house's temperature is getting a little too hot, it turns off the furnace. After a while, the water would leak out of the holes in the bucket and the depth would drop below the line. It wouldn't happen very fast, because the bucket stores volume and it would take a while for the volume to leak away. Similarly, the heat flows from a house through all of its heat leaks, and the house slowly drops in temperature as it loses heat. When the water goes below the marked line, you'd again turn on the faucet and begin the cycle again.
If you were very diligent, you'd be able to keep the depth pretty close to the line on the bucket by turning the faucet on and off properly. Since you were holding the depth more or less constant, the water lost through the holes would be more or less constant. If you held the depth constant for a long time, say an hour, the total volume that poured into the bucket would equal the volume that leaked out during the same hour. Just as the faucet adds as much volume each hour as is necessary to balance the water leakage during that hour, so a furnace adds the same amount of heat that leaks out of the house each hour.
Suppose we set the house's thermostat at 65 F instead of 70 F. What would happen? Heat losses would be less because the temperature difference would also be less. Your heating bill would be less too, because the furnace adds just what the house loses. Similarly, if you marked another line on the bucket at a lower level and kept the depth at this lower line, the water leakage would be less. Since depth differences drive out the water through the holes, less water leaks out. On the average, the faucet adds just as much water as leaks out, so you would use less water at the lower line that at the higher line.
Our country's leaders have urged us to turn down our thermostats to save scarce energy resources-now you have an understanding of why it helps.

8. HOUSE HEAT LOSSES
Houses lose their heat because it's hotter inside than outside. How exactly is the heat lost? Mostly it is lost in three ways: heat leaking by conduction through the walls and roof; heat leaking by radiation and convection through windows; and heat leaking by transport through cracks in windows and doors.
Conduction losses through walls and roofs usually account for about half of the total heat loss in an uninsulated house. But if fiberglass batting or plastic foam is used to insulate  the walls and thick fiberglass batting insulates the roof, the conduction losses can easily be cut in half. The thicker the insulation is, the less heat is lost by conduction. A roof with three inches of fiberglass insulation will lose twice as much heat as a roof with six inches of insulation.
The next most important heat loss is through windows. Even though ordinarily very little surface area of a house is made up of windows, heat losses through windows can amount to as much as the heat loss through an insulated wall. If a well-insulated wall of your house is one-tenth glass, as much heat can be lost by conduction through the wall as through windows-even though the wall has a ten times larger area.
Window heat loss takes place by conduction, convection, and radiation. Heat is convected and radiated to the inside surface of the glass by the warm room. Even though we can see through glass, in terms of radiation heat flow it's as if the glass weren't transparent at all: the glass prevents radiation heat from flowing directly outside. Once the heat reaches the inner surface of the glass, it is conducted through the glass. Glass is a good conductor, so the heat flows easily through the glass to the glass's outer surface. Once there, the heat flows outdoors by means of convection and radiation. Since the wind is often blowing outdoors, heat leaves the window's outer surface very easily.
The net effect of all these combined heat losses is that windows aren't very good insulators. Heat losses through windows can be cut down by using two layers of glass-as in doubled-glazed windows or storm windows. A double-glazed window has an air gap between the glass layers, so it's much harder for heat to flow through it. As with glass made of a single layer, it flows by convection and radiation to the window's inner surface. Then it flows by conduction through the first glass layer, by conduction and radiation through the air gap, by conduction through the outer glass layer, and finally by convection and radiation to the outdoors. Double-glazed windows lose about half as much heat as a single-layered window; most of this effect is due to the fact that the air gap acts as a good insulator.
The third major heat loss from a house is by infiltration- warm air leaking out through cracks in the walls, doors, windows and being replaced by cold outdoors air. Infiltration can account for one-third of the heat loss of an uninsulated house and a half or more of an insulated one. Many houses are poorly built, and thus have quite a bit of air infiltration. On other hand, if a house were completely sealed it would feel stuffy. In any case, cutting down on infiltration is an easy matter. Infiltration heat losses can be reduced by  weather-stripping doors and caulking windows.
To return to our water analogy. Recall that a house's heat losses are equivalent to the holes in the bottom of a bucket. If we insulate the house-reduce the conduction, window, and infiltration losses-it's like making the holes in the bucket smaller. Just as the furnace needs less heat to keep a  well-insulated house warm, so a faucet needs to add less water to a bucket with small holes to maintain a constant water level.
On the average, the furnace adds exactly what heat leaks out of the house. If less heat leaks out, the furnace uses less and your heating bill is less. Similarly, on the average the faucet adds the same amount of water to the bucket as leaks out of it. If the holes in the bucket are smaller, less water leaks out through them and less water is needed from the faucet.
Conserving heat in a house by better insulating is probably more important than solar heating the same house. A solar heating system that could save half of your heating bill might cost several times more than better insulation, which could also save half of your heating bill. If your house is already well insulated, then solar heating is probably worth the expense.

9. SOLAR RADIATION
Now you've seen how houses lose heat. But how can the sun help to provide house heat? Can the same kind of system be used for hot-water heating or swimming-pool heating? To answer these questions, first we have to know something about solar radiation.
Remember that radiation heat flow (already discussed in Chapter 5) is a form of heat flow that needs no medium-such as air, water, or metal-to flow through. Solar radiation is like radiation heat flow, but it differs in important ways from the radiation heat flow already discussed. The distinctions between the two kinds of radiation are critical ones, especially with regard to solar heating.
Solar radiation and radiation heat flow belong to a class of radiation called electromagnetic radiation. X-rays, light waves, microwaves, television waves, and radio waves also belong to this class. Sound is another class of radiation. Sound radiation is subdivided into various pitches. Kettledrums and tubas are designed to handle low pitches, whereas flutes and violins can handle high pitches. Even different species of animals have ears that can hear different pitches. A dog's ear or a bat's ear can hear high pitches that human beings can't hear. Solar radiation and radiation heat flow differ in the same way as sounds of different pitch do. In fact, you could think of solar radiation as high-pitched radiation heat flow.
In terms of solar heating, radiation heat flow and solar radiation differ in two important ways. First, color is a very important factor in solar radiation but is not too important in radiation heat flow. If a surface is exposed to the sun it will get very hot if it's painted black or a dark color, but it won't get very hot if it's painted white or a light color. Benjamin Franklin reportedly discovered this fact by laying a black cloth and a white cloth on the snow on a sunny winter day. The snow melted much more quickly under the black cloth than under the white one because the black one absorbed more solar radiation. The white cloth reflected the sunlight away, so it didn't absorb as much solar radiation and didn't melt as much snow. We will use a hollow arrow to denote solar radiation to distinguish it from the other kinds of heat flow.
Unlike solar radiation, radiation heat flow reacts in the same way to different colors. If we held a black cloth and a white cloth in front of a fireplace, both would get just as hot.
Recall that with radiation heat flow, the only way we could reflect the radiation was with a shiny surface. But with solar radiation both shiny surfaces and white or light-colored surfaces reflect the radiation. For example, you can get a worse sunburn on the beach than you can get on a golf course. On the beach you are exposed to solar radiation both directly from the sun and indirectly from the sun reflecting from the sand, but on a golf course lawn, you get the radiation only directly from the sun.
Solar radiation and radiation heat flow differ in a second important way. Solar radiation can go through transparent materials like glass that radiation heat flow cannot go through. If you held a piece of glass in front of you, it would block the radiation heat flow from a fireplace; but it wouldn't stop solar radiation from coming through. The tendency for solar radiation, but not radiation heat flow, to pass through glass is sometimes called the greenhouse effect. Heat can enter a greenhouse through its glass roof, but the same glass acts like a solid wall to heat trying to leave the greenhouse by means of radiation. Plastic materials behave a little differently. Although both glass and plastic let solar radiation pass through them, some plastic materials also let radiation heat flow through.
Other than the solar radiation's color sensitivity and its ability to pass through transparent materials, it behaves very much like radiation heat flow. It travels in straight lines, and it can be blocked by even thin material. To get out of the sun you get in the shade-the shade is simply anyplace where the solar radiation has been blocked. A tree can provide shade even though its leaves are very thin.

************************************************************************
10. SOLAR COLLECTOR ORIENTATION
A solar heating system has two major parts: the solar collectors and the heat storage. The collectors capture the solar radiation that strikes them. As much as possible of this heat is then stored in the heat storage, and from there it is delivered to the house.
Solar collectors can be thought of as big nets which gather the solar radiation that strikes them. Just as a bucket in a rainstorm collects rain, so a solar collector collects the solar radiation raining down on it.
If you were trying to collect the most rain you could in a bucket, you'd hold the bucket at the proper angle to catch the rain. The open top of the bucket is the rain collector, and you'd point it toward the rain. If the rain were coming straight down you'd hold the top level, but if the rain were driven by the wind you'd tilt the bucket so that the top would still face the rain. Similarly, a solar collector should point toward the sun to pick up the most solar radiation possible. How can you tell if the sun is pointed at the collectors? If a small peg sticking straight out from the collector leaves no shadow, then the collector is pointed straight at the sun.
The sun's position in the sky changes during the day as the earth rotates. In the morning the sun rises in the east; in the evening it sets in the west. At midday the sun is highest in the sky, but it is never directly overhead (at least not in the United States). If you were to face directly south for a whole day the sun would rise at your left, travel in an arc through the sky, and set at your right.
The sun's position also changes with the season. In the winter, the sun is lower in the sky at midday than it is in the summer. You can get a better idea of the seasonal change of the sun's position by thinking in terms of shadows. Since the sun is higher in the sky in the summer, your noontime shadow will be shorter than it will be in the winter.
The sun's position in the sky changes from hour to hour and also with the season, yet we want to catch the most sunlight possible from a flat-plate collector that can't move so that it always faces the sun. To do this, we compromise so that the collector is pointed south, whereby it most nearly faces the sun during the midday hours, even though some solar radiation is lost in the morning and evening hours. Although there is a best direction to face a flat-plate collector, depending on the local latitude (less tilt is needed in the south than the north), a tilted collector that generally faces the south performs adequately.
House-heating systems usually have a comparatively high tilt angle, since houses need the most solar heat in the winter when the sun is low. Hot-water systems need solar heat in both summer and winter, so they have a medium tilt angle-a compromise between facing the sun in the summer and the winter. Solar swimming-pool heaters usually have the lowest tilt angle. They need heat mostly in late spring, summer, and early fall when the sun is highest in the sky.

************************************************************************
11. A SIMPLE SOLAR COLLECTOR
Now we need to learn what a solar collector is. The simplest kind of flat-plate solar collector is just a black-painted metal plate with a layer of insulation on the back side. It's painted black because black best absorbs solar radiation, as we discussed in Chapter 9. Since insulators prevent heat from conducting through them, the insulation on the collector prevents heat loss from the collector's back side.
If we faced the plate toward the sun at noon, it would begin to get hot as it absorbed solar heat. How hot would it get?
We can learn a lot about a solar collector by thinking of it in terms of a rainwater collector. Imagine that we are building a device to collect rainwater. As a start, we get a big tray to catch the rainwater, just as a solar collector collects, or absorbs, solar radiation. We attach a capped pipe to the tray so that all the rain falling in the tray will flow down the pipe and be caught.
Suppose the only capped pipe we can find is one that leaks. As the tray collects rain, the pipe fills; but rainwater flows out through the leak. The deeper the water gets in the pipe, the more water leaks out. At some point the depth gets so high that the flow out the leak balances the incoming flow of rainwater. Once this point is reached, the water gets no deeper. When the incoming rainwater exactly balances the outgoing water loss through the leak, the depth of water in the pipe is at its stagnation depth.
Similarly, the stagnation temperature is how hot a collector gets when the incoming solar radiation exactly balances the heat losses that take place by radiation and convection. To continue our analogy, the tray captures rainwater as the solar collector captures solar radiation. Just as the water in the pipe gets deeper and deeper, so does the temperature of the plate become hotter and hotter. And just as more water flows out through the leak as the water In the pipe gets deeper, so more heat leaks off the front of the solar collector by radiation and convection as the plate gets hotter. At some point the plate gets so hot that the heat losses exactly balance the incoming solar radiation. Once this point is reached, the plate gets no hotter.
The stagnation temperature of a surface-the hottest a surface exposed to the sun can get-depends on how much solar radiation is absorbed. The amount of radiation absorbed depends on the color of the surface, the angle of the sun's rays striking the collector, and how much sunlight actually strikes it. The best setup to use to absorb solar radiation is the one just described: a black surface squarely facing the sun on a clear day. A light-colored surface, a surface not directly facing the sun, or an overcast day will reduce the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the surface.
How will less absorbed radiation affect the stagnation temperature? Let's use the analogy of the rainwater collector again to understand what happens. Suppose a light rain is falling  on the tray rather than a heavy rain-that's comparable to less solar radiation striking the solar collector. With less rain falling, the tray collects less and the incoming rainwater flow is less. Recall that when we discussed house heating, we found that a lower water depth in the bucket resulted in less flow out through the bucket's holes: high depths are associated with high leakage; low depths, with low leakage. Thus, if less rainwater is flowing down the pipe, the depth needn't be as high to force all of the incoming water out through the holes. The water in the pipe wouldn't be as deep before the flow out through the holes balanced the incoming rainwater flow. We can conclude from this that if the incoming rainwater is less, the stagnation depth also goes down.
How can we apply this analogy to the solar collector? We would expect the stagnation temperature to be less if the absorbed solar radiation was less (since the stagnation depth was less when the rainfall was less). When less solar radiation is absorbed, our simple solar collector starts to get hot. It will lose more and more heat as it gets hotter. Eventually the heat losses will equal the amount of solar radiation absorbed. But since the solar radiation absorbed is less, the collector won't be very hot when the losses balance the absorbed radiation.
How hot our simple solar collector gets depends on how much solar radiation it absorbs. We've gotten the plate hot, but we haven't gotten any heat from it yet-the plate may be collecting solar radiation, but it's not doing us any good. You can't pay your heating bills with a hot black plate. We want heat from a solar heating system, not temperature.

************************************************************************
12. A SOLAR HEATING SYSTEM
Not only do we want to extract heat from our collector, but we also want to store this same heat to use after the sun goes down. We can accomplish both purposes by using transport heat flow. Our simple insulated plate collector can be modified by soldering metal tubing onto the back of the plate and pumping water through the tubing.
Using both metal tubing and metal plate is important, since heat flows easily through metal by conduction. In this case, the heat flows from where the sun hits the plate to where the tubing is soldered to the plate. Convection into a liquid, like water, is excellent, so the heat flowing into the tubing easily heats the water. Insulation is again used on the back side of the collector to prevent heat from leaking away.
After solar heat flows into the water, it can be transported from the collector by pumping the heated water to a heat storage tank. A heat storage tank is a water-filled tank covered with insulation to prevent heat loss. The pump transports water from the storage tank to the collector, where it is solar heated, and is then pumped back to the storage tank in a continuous cycle. We learned earlier that transport heat flow depends on how fast the water is pumped. Let's assume that we've sized the pump so that the water flows fast enough to let heat flow easily out of the collector and into storage. At the same time, the pump won't be so big that the power needed to run it will be significant compared with the heat collected by our system.
To return to the water analogy: we don't want only a high depth in the pipe of the rainwater tray. We want to extract and store some rainwater for use when the rain stops. If we use a fat tube to connect the bottom of the pipe to a big tank, some of the rainwater will flow into the tank. The tube is fat enough so the water in the pipe can flow easily into the tank.
The fat tube is analogous to the pump used in the solar heating system. Just as the pump lets transport heat flow easily from the solar collector to the heat storage tank, so the fat tube lets volume flow easily from the rainwater collector to the rainwater storage tank.
Suppose a heavy rain is falling on the rainwater tray. The water will flow down the pipe and start filling the tank. Some of the incoming rainwater will flow into the tank, and some will flow out the leak. Since we want to store as much rainwater as we can, we'd like as little as possible to leak away. When only a small fraction of the incoming rainwater leaks away, we say we have high collection efficiency. We're efficiently using the rainwater by storing lots of it and letting only a little leak away. By contrast, we have low collection efficiency when a large fraction of the incoming rainwater leaks away and only a small fraction is stored.
When do we get high collection efficiency and when do we get low collection efficiency? The easiest way to understand collection efficiency is to remember that high efficiency happens  only when leakage is low. Leakage is low only when the depth of water in the pipe is low-a nearly empty pipe leaks less than a full one.
In the rainwater collecting apparatus we're discussing, we could get high efficiency or low efficiency, depending on the depth of the water in the pipe. For example, if the water depth in the tank were low, the depth of water in the pipe would also be low (the fat tube makes sure both have about the same depth). A low pipe depth means high efficiency: little leakage and lots of flow to storage. The same apparatus would give us low collection efficiency if the storage tank were nearly full. A full tank would indicate that the water depth in the pipe was also high (the fat tube insures this), resulting in high losses. Of course, if most of what is coming into the pipe were lost through leakage, the collection efficiency would be low.
Now that you have some understanding of collection efficiency, let's return to the solar heater. We'll assume it's about noon on a bright, sunny day: the collector is absorbing lots of solar radiation.
When the heat storage tank is cool, then cool water is pumped through the collector. The sun warms it somewhat, so it comes out a little warmer than it went in, but on the average the solar collector plate stays fairly cool. With a cool solar collector plate, heat losses by radiation and convection are small, so little heat is lost. Lots of heat goes to storage and efficiency is high. Similarly, when the rainwater tank has little water in it, the depth in the pipe is low, so little rainwater is lost through the leak. Lots of water goes to storage and efficiency is high.
When the storage temperature is hot, the water being pumped to the solar collector is also hot. The collector, in turn, gets hotter. But when the collector gets hot, it loses more heat from its front plate by radiation and convection. Since more solar heat is lost, less heat is stored and the efficiency Is low.
A hot collector means low-efficiency solar collection. We learned earlier that the hottest a collector can get is its stagnation temperature. But at its stagnation temperature its efficiency is precisely zero-it loses all the solar radiation it absorbs. If the water pumped to the collector is cooler than the stagnation temperature, some solar heat can be stored: the cooler the water, the higher the efficiency. The highest efficiency is achieved when very cold water is pumped into the collector. The tendency for efficiency to depend on temperature is an inherent feature of all solar heaters. It has an important effect on how solar energy can be applied to various kinds of heating needs.

************************************************************************
13. SOLAR HEATING APPLICATIONS
Efficiency, as we've just learned, depends on the collector's temperature. A collector that stays cool loses little heat to the outdoors; one that's hot leaks a lot of heat. Consider a solar swimming-pool heater. Collectors on the roof, quite similar to the ones just described in Chapter 12, absorb solar radiation and heat the water being pumped through them. But, instead of using a storage tank, the pool itself stores the solar-heated water.
A swimming-pool solar collector gets very high efficiency because it uses heat only at relatively low temperatures. The water pumped into the collector is cool water from the pool. The water going into the collectors might be 80 F and the water coming out might be 90 F, so on the average the collector stays fairly cool. Solar pool heaters are used mostly in the late spring and early fall, so the daytime temperature (when all the solar collecting is going on) is perhaps 60 to 80 F. Since heat loss is due to temperature difference, the small temperature difference (maybe 20 F) between the collector and the outdoors means little heat will be lost from a solar swimming-pool collector. Low heat loss, of course, means high efficiency. Even the simplest solar swimming-pool collectors can get efficiencies of 75 percent or more. Three-quarters of the solar radiation striking the collector ends up heating the pool water; only  one-quarter of the heat is lost.
For most other applications of solar heating-notably home heating and hot-water heating-conditions are not so favorable for high efficiency. For example, in solar heating your home, the temperature on a cold winter day might be 30 F outdoors at the same time the storage tank temperature is 130 F. A 100 F temperature difference between the collector and the outdoors means you would lose about five times the heat of a solar pool heater when the temperature difference was only 20 F. With losses this high, efficiency would be very low.
In heating water the problem is similar to house heating: it's cold outside and you want hot water. Lukewarm water coming from a solar water heater isn't good enough. As in house heating, the daytime temperature in winter might be about 30 F outdoors while the stored heat might be at 130 F. Again, a 100F temperature difference between the collector and outdoors means that lots of heat is lost and efficiency is low.
Note that in the solar hot-water heater, the storage tank and the collectors are much smaller than those used for house heating. Since in most parts of the country more heat is needed to heat a house than to heat water for the same house, a solar hot-water heater is usually quite small compared with a solar space-heating system.
For either house heating or hot-water heating a simple solar collector such as the one we've discussed so far won't work too well. What's appropriate for swimming-pool heating is too inefficient for house and hot-water heating.

************************************************************************
14. GLAZING AND SELECTIVE SURFACES
How do we get both high temperature and high efficiency from a solar heating system? We need high temperature (130 F) for house and hot-water heating, but we also want high efficiency so the system will be economical. If we were only gathering rainwater, it would be easy to see how to get higher efficiency: we would try to stop the leakage.
If we simply tied a rag tightly around the leaking pipe, it would be harder for the water to leak out. With less leakage efficiency is higher, since a greater fraction of the incoming rainwater flows into the storage tank.
Remember that the water depth in the pipe in the rainwater collector is equivalent to the collector temperature in a solar collector. High rainwater collection efficiency is equivalent to high solar collection efficiency. If we want high solar efficiency and hot collector temperatures, we'll have to stop heat from leaking from the collector; just as we would use a rag to stop rainwater from leaking out of the pipe.
Glazing is one way to reduce heat loss from a collector. Glazing is a transparent cover, usually made of glass or plastic. It is held a few inches from the collector surface by the glazing frame. Since solar radiation passes through glass or plastic, almost all of it is still absorbed by the black collector surface. But with glazing, heat can't escape as easily.
The biggest heat loss, by far, on an unglazed collector takes place by convection (although radiation losses can be one-fifth of the total). Convection losses are high mostly because the collector is exposed to the windy outdoors. As we have learned, when air blows over a surface, the surface loses heat easily. A collector on the roof of a house is seldom in still air.
Glazing prevents heat loss from the collector surface by isolating it from the wind. The air inside the glazing cover is still air; heat flows from the black surface by natural convection  rather than by forced convection (the wind). First, some heat will leave the collector surface by means of natural convection; then it must flow into the inside surface of the glazing, again by natural convection. Next, conduction heat flow takes it through the glazing, and finally the wind blows it off the outer surface of the glazing by forced convection. You put pizza in a box for the same reason as a solar collector has glazing-the box prevents convection heat loss from the pizza.
The glazing also reduces the amount of radiation heat flowing from the collector surface. Since radiation heat flow is mostly blocked by glass (and partially blocked by plastic), the radiation heat flow sees the inner surface of the glazing rather than the sky. The inner surface of the glazing is hotter than the sky temperature, so radiation heat loss is less with the smaller temperature difference.
Another way to prevent heat loss from a collector is to coat its surface with a selective coating. The coating absorbs the high-pitched solar radiation just as black paint does, but it prevents most of the low-pitched radiation heat flow from leaving the collector surface. These special coatings are called selective because they react differently to solar radiation than to radiation heat flow. Usually they're used with glazing. A bare unglazed collector loses only one-fifth of its heat by radiation, whereas four-fifths of its heat is lost by wind convection. A glazed collector, though, has very low convection heat loss, so the radiation portion of heat loss becomes a substantial part of the total-about half. By further reducing the radiation portion of the heat loss from a glazed collector with a selective surface, the total heat loss of a glazed collector can be cut down substantially.
The net effect of glazing and selective coatings is that they allow solar radiation in but prevent heat losses from the collector, just as the rag prevents rainwater from leaking away from a pipe.
A collector with glazing delivers high temperatures at high efficiency-exactly what is needed for house heating and hot-water heating. A glazed collector loses less heat to the out doors than an unglazed one at the same temperature, just as the pipe with the rag leaks less rainwater than one without a rag at the same water depth.
Whether or not glazing is needed depends simply on the temperature required from the solar heater and the outside temperature at which it must operate. Solar house heaters and solar hot-water heaters must deliver high temperatures and usually operate in cold weather, and they are commonly glazed. Solar pool heaters don't need to deliver hot water and usually operate in mild weather, so they are commonly unglazed. However, pool heaters used in winter are often glazed, and hot-water heaters used in warm climates (parts of Israel, for instance) are often left unglazed.

************************************************************************
15. NIGHTTIME HEAT LOSS
The solar collector has captured the sun's heat during the day, and the captured heat has been pumped to storage. But what happens when the sun goes down or the sky clouds over? Again, we'll use our rainwater apparatus to understand what happens.
Suppose the rainwater tank is nearly filled and the rain stops. What will happen? With no rain falling on the rain collecting tray, no rainwater flows down the pipe. But water can still flow into the pipe from the tank through the tube that connects the two. The water depth in the pipe, then, will have almost the same depth as the water in the tank, since water can flow easily between them. However, when there is water in the pipe it leaks out-the higher the depth, the more the leakage. The net result is that stored water can flow out of storage and into the pipe and then flow out the leak. All the carefully collected rainwater leaks away as soon as the rain stops.
To prevent loss from the tank when the rain stops, we can put a check valve in the tube connecting the pipe and the tank. A check valve is a device that blocks the flow of water in one  direction but allows it to flow in the other direction. Check valves are common devices to let a liquid flow in only one direction; in fact, your own heart has several such valves to keep your blood flowing in the right direction.
With a check valve inserted in the tube between the pipe and the tank, rainwater can flow easily from the pipe to the tank when the tray is catching rainwater. But when the rain stops, the check valve prevents any stored water from flowing back out the tank and into the pipe where it leaks away.
The same process can occur in a solar heating system. Heat in the heat storage tank can be lost after the sun goes down. When solar radiation is not being absorbed by the collector  plate, the water loses heat as it passes through the collector; it does not gain heat. Hot water pumped from the storage tank to the collector is hotter than the outdoors temperature, so heat flows by radiation and convection to the outdoors.
As stored water from the rainwater collector tank leaks away when the rain stops, so stored heat leaks from the solar collector tank when the sun is not out. In the rainwater system, we can use a check valve to prevent rainwater from flowing back from the tank to the pipe. The check valve lets rainwater into the tank, not out of it where it can leak away. In our solar heating system, the same effect can be achieved simply by stopping the pump whenever the sun isn't shining. Just as the check valve senses when the tank depth is greater than the pipe depth-in other words, when rainwater is leaving the tank-temperature sensors detect when the heat storage tank is hotter than the collector-when heat is leaving storage-and they control the pump. If the storage tank is hotter than the collector, the pump is shut off; if the collector is hotter than the storage tank, the pump is turned on.

16. A TYPICAL DAY: MORNING
Now that we've examined all the elements of a solar heating system, let's see how it operates during a typical winter day. Right now we'll consider only collecting and storing heat; later we'll see how we use the stored heat. We'll also follow the operation of our rainwater collecting apparatus so comparisons can be made between the two at various stages.
Let's assume that both collecting systems begin the day partly full. For example, in the rainwater collector, there might have been some rainwater left from previous rain. In the solar collecting system, we'll assume the heat storage tank is still warm from the previous day's collection.
In the rainwater apparatus, the check valve has closed to keep the stored water from leaking out. No rain is falling, and any water in the pipe has long since leaked out. As for the solar heater, the sun has not yet risen. The collector, which has been exposed to the cold night air, is much colder than the heat storage tank. The heat storage is warmer than the outdoors because it still contains heat. The controller had sensed that the collector was colder than the heat storage tank and shut off the pump, preventing the storage tank from cooling.
As the sun rises, the collector starts to get a little warmer. But since a south-oriented collector doesn't face the sun early in the morning, not much solar radiation is absorbed. The collector will get warmer, but not as warm as the heat storage. Since the collector is still colder than the storage tank, the controller won't turn on the pump. Of course, the collector is a little warmer than the outdoors, so it loses heat through its glazing. In fact, it loses all the heat absorbed by the collector: since none is saved, all of the incoming heat is lost.
For the rainwater apparatus to be analogous to our solar collector, let's suppose that it starts to drizzle on the rainwater collecting tray. Since little rainwater is being collected, the water in the collection pipe doesn't get as deep as the storage depth. No rainwater flows into storage, and efficiency is zero-all the rain captured by the tray leaks away.
Until the temperature of a collector gets hotter than the storage tank, no heat is collected. Often on cloudy days, a solar collector doesn't collect any heat whatsoever, just as when the sun first rises in the morning not enough solar radiation falls on the collector to make its stagnation temperature hotter than the storage tank's. The heat leaks away from the collector as fast as it is absorbed. The cold temperature outdoors aggravates the situation, since the incoming solar radiation must further raise the collector's temperature so that it equals the storage temperature.
As the sun gets higher in the sky, its radiation strikes the collector more and more head-on, and more solar radiation is absorbed by the collector plate. Eventually the collector plate gets hotter than the storage tank. When it does get hotter, the pump controller senses the temperature difference between the collector and the storage tank and turns on the pump. With pump water flowing, some of the heat absorbed by the collector is moved into storage: water flowing from storage is heated as it passes through the collector. Warm water from the collector further heats up the storage tank. Now not all the collector's heat is lost, since some of it is going into storage.
In the rainwater collection system, let's suppose the rain increases from a drizzle to a light rain; this is analogous to more sunshine being absorbed by the solar collector. With more rainwater  collected and flowing down the pipe, the pipe's water depth gets higher than the storage water depth. The check valve opens and not all the rainwater is lost through the leak, since some is flowing into storage.
In the late morning the sun faces the collector nearly head-on; and much more solar radiation is absorbed by the collector  plate. With the pump on, warm water from storage is pumped through the collector, where it is further heated. It returns to the storage tank hotter and continues to heat the tank. The collector always stays a little hotter than the storage tank, so the controller always keeps the pump on. Efficiency is high in the late morning. The collector receives water from storage, and before noon storage isn't very hot yet. When the collector isn't hot, heat losses are low, resulting in high efficiency.
The rainwater equivalent to the sun hitting the collector nearly head-on is a heavy rain. The incoming water fills up the pipe and flows through the check valve into the storage tank. Since the pipe's water depth isn't too high yet, not much rainwater is lost and efficiency is high.

************************************************************************
17. A TYPICAL DAY: AFTERNOON
The midday hours (10:00 A.M. through 2:00 P.M.) are the most important for solar collecting. During these hours the sun faces the collector almost head-on. A large fraction of the solar heat collected in a day occurs during these midday hours. By contrast, the early morning sun doesn't face the collector squarely, and the same is true in the late afternoon. In addition, the early morning and late afternoon sunlight has to pass through more of the atmosphere on its way to the collector.
Solar radiation is diminished as it goes through the atmosphere, so less of it reaches the collector during the early morning and late afternoon. During the midday hours the sun angle is better, and the sunlight passes through less atmosphere as well. In fact, in winter, a flat-plate collector can collect almost as much heat as a tracking collector, which has a tracking mechanism to keep the collector always pointed at the sun. Even though the tracking collector can face the early morning and the late afternoon sun, there isn't much solar radiation to be collected then anyway. One that doesn't move at all can collect almost as much heat, yet be simpler and cost less.
A few hours past noon, most of the solar heat to be stored during the day has been moved by transport heat flow to the storage tank. The water in storage won't get much hotter, since little more heat will be added. Enough solar radiation is still present to heat the collector so that it is slightly hotter than the storage tank. But efficiency has fallen off: the collector is much hotter than the outdoors, making losses high. High losses mean little heat collected and lower efficiency.
In the rainwater system, a heavy rain is still falling-analogous  to the sun being nearly square to the solar collector. But after heavy rain for a long time, the storage water depth and the water depth of the pipe are much higher. The pipe's water depth is high enough to force much of the rainwater out of the leak. High leakage leaves little of the incoming flow to go to storage, so efficiency is lower.
Late in the afternoon the sun faces the collector less squarely, and less solar radiation is transmitted through the atmosphere, as we discussed earlier. The net effect of these factors is that the solar radiation absorbed by the collector falls off rapidly. But losses are still high, since they are determined by how hot the water coming from storage is. Eventually the collector can't absorb enough heat to stay hotter than the storage tank. When the collector gets cooler than the storage tank, the controller shuts off the pump. Of course, efficiency is zero when the pump is off. Any incoming solar radiation that is absorbed is lost completely through the glazing.
Let's suppose that the heavy rain falling on our rainwater tray diminishes, just as the solar radiation absorbed by the solar collector in the late afternoon is reduced. Less rainwater flows down the pipe, but there's still a lot of leakage since the pipe's water depth is so high. The reduced inflow can't maintain as high a stagnation depth in the pipe because so much is leaking out. When the pipe's water depth drops below the storage water depth the check valve closes, preventing loss of our carefully stored rainwater out through the pipe's leak. As soon as the check valve closes, efficiency drops to zero: all the rainwater flowing down the pipe leaks away.
Finally the sun sets. The solar collecting system appears from the outside just as it did before the sun rose that same morning. The collector, exposed to the cold night air, is much colder than the heat storage tank. No water is pumped from storage to collector because the controller has long since sensed that the storage is hotter. Only the temperature of the storage water has changed. Whereas before dawn it was only warm, after sunset It is much hotter.
Similarly, when the rain stops falling on the rainwater collector, the only difference is the amount of stored rainwater. The water in the pipe has long since leaked out and the check valve is closed, preventing loss of the stored rainwater. The net effect of the rain falling has been simply to store some portion of the rain caught by the collecting tray. Although some rainwater leaked away, the storage water depth after the rainstorm is much higher than it was before.

18. USING STORED HEAT
Solar heat has been collected and stored in order to be used. In a swimming-pool heater it's easy to use the stored heat. Instead of pumping the solar-heated water to a heat storage tank, the pool itself stores the sun's heat. But if we're trying to heat a house or water, we need some way to get the heat out of storage. By analogy, if we want to get the rainwater from the rainwater collector, one way would be to tap into the side of the storage tank. We can tap off some stored rainwater whether we're simultaneously collecting rainwater or whether the rain has stopped and we're only tapping off the stored rainwater.
Similarly, a heat storage tank can be tapped to yield its stored heat. However, instead of actually removing the hot water from the storage tank, a heat exchanger is usually used to extract the heat-but not hot water. A heat exchanger consists of a coil of copper tubing which sits inside the heat storage tank; cool water is pumped into one end of the coil and hot water flows out the other end. The stored hot water heats the outer surface of the copper coil by natural convection; the heat flows easily through the copper by conduction. The water flowing through the coil is then heated by convection from the hot copper surfaces that the water flows past. This kind of heat exchanger is called a liquid-to-liquid heat exchanger, since heat is transferred from one liquid (the hot storage water) to another (the water pumped through the coil).
Cool water can be pumped into the heat exchanger whether or not the solar energy system is also collecting heat. It is possible to withdraw heat from storage while simultaneously adding solar heat to storage. The only requirement for the heat exchanger is that the stored water must be hotter than the cool incoming water.
Let's consider the case of heating water. Usually a solar heating system is used as a preheater for a conventional gas, oil, or electrical hot-water heater. Cold water from a well or water main flows through the heat exchanger before going to the conventional auxiliary unit, as it is sometimes called.
The preheater arrangement has several advantages. First, the stored solar-heated water only has to be hotter than the water main temperature to extract stored heat. Usually, the water main temperature is about the same as the ground temperature, so even a little sunlight can heat the water from the main. Second, if the solar heater cannot get the water hot enough, the auxiliary hot-water heater can top it off. In the winter, for example, the water main temperature could be 50 F. The solar heater might only be able to heat it to 100 F. The auxiliary heater needs only to heat it another 30 for its temperature to reach the desired 130 F. Most of the heat was added by the solar heater, but some was added by the auxiliary heater. Since most people are accustomed to regulated hot water, having a conventional auxiliary unit in addition to the solar preheater is almost a necessity.
Similarly, in house heating, a solar heating system can be used as a preheater for a conventional furnace. Let's suppose we're solar heating a house that is heated by forced air (forcing heated air through air ducts). We can extract solar heat from our storage tank with a liquid-to-air heat exchanger.
Recall that we've already used a liquid-to-liquid heat exchanger to extract heat from our storage for hot-water heating. The two types of heat exchangers look distinctly different.  This is because it is so much easier to transfer heat to water than to air, and much more surface must be exposed to the air than to the water.
In a liquid-to-air heat exchanger (a car radiator is one type), hot water pumped through many parallel tubes transfers heat to the air by way of hundreds of thin metal fins attached to the tubes. Heat flows easily into the metal tubes from the flowing hot water. Then it's conducted easily along the fins, insuring that lots of hot fin surface is exposed to the air blowing by. Because heat doesn't flow easily by convection from a surface into air, a lot of fin surface is needed and the air must blow fast over the fins.
In heating a house with a solar preheater, a liquid-to-liquid heat exchanger draws heat from the solar heat storage and feeds it into a liquid-to-air heat exchanger. The latter transfers heat to the air flowing into a furnace-often an electric furnace. If the air is sufficiently hot, the furnace's coils never come on. But if the solar heat storage is too cool, the coil of the furnace will add additional heat to the air.
Solar heat is also used as a preheater for a conventional heating system. Note that even though electricity is a very expensive fuel, it is used only a fraction of the time: the house is primarily solar heated, and electricity is used as a back-up.
So far we've talked about preheater, or series arrangements of solar and auxiliary heating systems. Series, in electrical terms, means flowing first into one and then into the other; the auxiliary adds its heat only after the solar heat is added. Another arrangement is a parallel one where both the solar heating system and the auxiliary unit directly heat the house. An example of a parallel arrangement is a house that is simultaneously heated by electric baseboard heating and hot-water baseboard heating. Both systems add heat to the house, but the electric auxiliary system comes on only when the temperature of the solar storage is insufficient to heat the house.
There are many other ways that solar energy can be coupled with an auxiliary unit for house and hot-water heating. The ones shown here are just a few of the possibilities.
But why have an auxiliary unit at all? Without one you couldn't count on having your hot water or house heated after several days of cloudy weather. Then why not store a week's supply of heat? From an economic viewpoint, storing much more than a day or two's heat supply becomes expensive. A storage tank that holds a week's supply of heat costs much more than one that holds a day's supply. Although some solar energy heating systems have been, built to store heat for months at a time, the majority of residential systems store only a day's heat supply.

************************************************************************
19. AIR-HEATING SOLAR SYSTEMS
So far we've only discussed hydronic, or water-heating, solar energy systems. It's also practical to let solar radiation heat air instead of water. An air-heating solar collector is very similar to the water-heating collectors we've already learned about. Air, instead of water, is forced past solar-heated surfaces.
Most air-heating solar collectors are made with an absorber surface with air ducts instead of water ducts attached to the back side. As in a water-heating collector, glazing prevents  heat loss from the black absorbing surface. An inlet duct lets air be blown into one side of the collector, and an outlet duct lets it flow out the other side. Insulation prevents heat loss from the sides and back of the air duct.
After solar radiation passes through the glazing, it is absorbed by the black absorbing surface. Some heat is lost by natural convection and radiation from the absorbing surface, depending on how hot it gets-as in a water-heating solar collector. What is not lost flows by conduction through the absorbing surface to the air duct where it flows by forced convection into the airstream and is transported to storage.
In air-heating solar collectors, lots of surface area must be exposed to the airstream. Often the back side of the absorbing surface has many fins, as do liquid-to-air heat exchangers and baseboard heaters. Heat conducted through the metal absorbing surface is conducted along the fins. With lots of fin surface exposed to the air in the ducts, solar heat can easily flow by convection into the airstream.
Storage for an air-heating system is a rockbed-a closed container of crushed rocks, each about the size of an egg. As the hot air flows through the crevices in the rockbed, it gives up its heat to the rocks. The rocks heat up and the air cools. If much smaller rocks are used, it's hard for the air to flow through the crevices; if much larger rocks are used, they don't heat up thoroughly. Heat in the rockbed stratifies; the rocks higher up are hotter than those near the bottom of the bed. Air coming from the bottom of the rockbed is cooler than the solar-heated air entering the top.
Functionally, the air-heating system works almost exactly the same as a water-heating system does. Solar heat is transmitted through the glazing and is absorbed by the black absorbing surface. The heat is conducted from the absorber surface  and convected by air flowing through air ducts. Similarly, in a hydronic system, heat is also conducted from the absorber surface but is convected by water pumped through tubes. In both types of collector, heat is lost from the absorbing surface by means of radiation and convection, depending on how hot the surface gets. The heat that isn't lost is transported to storage by either air or water. As in a water-heating system, storage increases in temperature as heat is added. Cooler air (rather than cooler water) is blown (rather than pumped) back to the collector. Efficiency-the fraction of the incoming solar radiation going to storage-still depends on the collector temperature: a hot collector gives low efficiency and a cool collector gives high efficiency.
As in a water-heating system, a controller detects when the temperature of the air leaving the solar collector is hotter than the air entering it. The controller turns on the fan when heat can be extracted from the sun, and it turns it off at night or on cloudy days when no useful solar heat is available.
All in all, air-heating systems function much the way water-heating systems do. In fact, the systems are so similar that the rainwater analogy can represent both. However, although  they are functionally similar, there are important differences in the design of the two types of systems.
One way solar air-heating collectors differ from water-heating ones is in temperature rise. Temperature rise is the difference between how hot the air is going into the collector and how hot it is coming out. Since air doesn't transport heat as well as water does, air flowing through a collector tends to heat up more. If the same amount of air and water were flowing into their respective collectors at the same temperature, the air would come out hotter than the water. If the air comes out hotter, then the average collector temperature would be hotter too-and a hot collector means low efficiency.
Fortunately, air-heating systems don't have low efficiency, since the air blowing into them is cooler. Because of the stratified effect mentioned earlier, air flowing into the collector comes from the rockbed fairly cool. Cool air entering the solar collector tends to lower the collector's temperature and to improve efficiency. The improvement due to the cool inlet of air from the rockbed offsets the reduced efficiency of a big temperature rise through the collector: the air starts off cooler but gets hotter. The net effect is that an air-heating system is just as efficient as a water-heating system.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of using an air-heating system? Generally, air systems are best for house heating, while hydronic systems can be used for house heating, hot-water heating, and pool heating. Although it is possible to make an air-heating hot-water heater or pool heater (using an air-to-liquid heat exchanger), it is usually too costly to be practical.
For house heating, an air-heating system won't spring a leak and ruin your rug as a water-heating system might do. Leaks in hydronic systems can be caused by corrosion of metal collectors and pipes or by freezing, as we'll see later. Leaks in air-heating systems won't ruin your rug, but they can mean a big loss in efficiency. Unless air leaks in ducts and collectors are carefully sealed, heat can easily leak away. If there are air leaks, they are very hard to detect.
But the greatest advantage of an air-heating system is that no freezing or boiling precautions must be taken. Water in a hydronic system can freeze, rupturing a solar collector's water carrying passages. Since almost everywhere in the United States except Hawaii, southern California, and southern Florida have occasional freezing weather, hydronic systems must have some type of freeze protection. Antifreeze is often added to the water as protection against freezing, or drain-down systems can be installed to drain the water from the collector at night to prevent it from freezing.
Water can also boil in a hydronic solar collector if it gets too hot. It probably won't boil while the pump is running, since the water pumped through the collector keeps it relatively cool. But if the pump breaks down or the electricity goes out, the collector  can get very hot. Stagnation temperatures of 300 F and higher can occur on a bright, sunny day. To prevent the collector water from boiling, chemicals like glycol can be added, or the system can be set up to drain the collector automatically if the pump stops working. In any event, freezing and boiling precautions can add expense and complication to a solar heating system that an air-heating system doesn't entail.
What about the disadvantages of air-heating systems? There are some. First, an air-heating system tends to use more electricity driving its fans than a hydronic system does driving its pumps. Second, the ducts needed to transport the heat from the solar collector to the storage tank and then from storage to the rest of the house can be much bulkier than the piping in a hydronic system. Also, the bulky ducts are generally more expensive to install than are the pipes.
Now that we've looked at solar energy systems that use pumps or fans to transport heat from collector to storage, let's look at some systems that are truly solar powered.

************************************************************************
20. A PASSIVE SYSTEM - DIRECT GAIN
Passive solar heating systems are those which don't use pumps or fans to transport the solar heat. They are passive because all they use to operate is the sun's heat. Active systems, such as we've learned about so far, use active power-usually electricity- to operate.
A direct-gain passive system is the simplest of passive solar heating systems. As with most passive systems, they are used primarily for house heating. In a direct-gain system, the house itself becomes a huge solar collector. Imagine a house that had the entire south wall made of glass and had lots of insulation on the roof and other walls. Sunlight entering the south-facing wall would be absorbed by the floor, furniture, and inside walls. The heat would be trapped inside by the glass wall just as a solar collector's heat is trapped by glazing. Well-insulated roof and walls prevents heat loss out of the house just the way a collector's insulation prevents heat loss out of the back of the collector.
The simple direct-gain house might not be very comfortable to live in. During the day it could get very hot inside-remember how hot your car gets after sitting all day in the sun with the windows shut. At night it could get cold, because little of the solar heat collected during the day would be available to heat the house at night. For some buildings these problems aren't crucial. A school, for example, needs heat only during the day, and windows can always be opened to keep the building from getting too hot. Homes and most other buildings, though, need heat at night as well as during the day.
Active solar heating systems need storage to hold solar heat until night, and so do passive systems. Storage can be added to the direct-gain system just described by constructing the floor and inside walls of material that stores heat. For example, the floors can be made of thick rock or concrete. When the sun strikes the floor, the rock heats up and remains warm until nighttime; as it slowly loses its heat, it keeps the house warm.
Sometimes drums of water are put inside a room to increase heat storage-water, remember, stores more heat than rock or concrete do. For best results, the water drums or thick rock floor should be in the direct sunlight, so that the storage is also the solar radiation absorber. The more heat storage there is in water drums and rock floors, the less tendency there is for a direct-gain house to overheat. A huge heat store will not get as hot after a day of absorbing solar heat, nor will it cool as quickly at night. The bigger the heat store, the less the temperature swing-the tendency to be too hot in the late afternoon and too cold in the morning.
The rainwater analogy to a direct-gain house is a collector tray directly attached to a large storage tank. The tank is large because the equivalent heat storage must be large to reduce temperature swing. The tank represents the heat stored in the house's floor or water drums; the water depth in the tank represents the house's temperature. A house loses heat to the outdoors; analogously, the tank must also have a leak. As before, the pipe on the collecting tray has a leak; it represents the heat leaking from the glass south wall on our direct-gain house. The rainwater tray collects the rain, filling the tank. When the rain stops, no rainwater flows down the pipe but water is still lost from both the pipe leak and the tank leak. The water level will slowly drop as the rainwater leaks out. It takes a long time to fill a large tank, so its depth doesn't rise very high; nor does a large tank drain quickly. The bigger the tank is, the less is the rise and fall of the water depth. Analogously, the bigger the heat storage is, the less the temperature swing is.
When we learned about active systems, we learned that the controller serves an important function in preventing nighttime  heat loss. The solar collectors in an active system are separated  from the storage. Only the heat transfer medium (air or water) moves heat from the collectors to the storage. When the controller turns off the fan or pump, no heat can be transported from storage back to the collector. In a direct-gain system, though, the collector and storage aren't separated. The solar collector is the heat storage (the thick concrete floors).
Unless the collector and the storage are separated, heat can leak from storage out the collector's glazing. Remember, in Chapter 8 we found that windows leak ten times the amount of heat of a well-insulated wall. An entire south wall of glass, then, represents a big heat loss. Even though the glass wall admits solar radiation during the day that heats the thick floor, at night the same glass wall loses much of the stored heat to the outdoors.
Not only do active solar heating systems have their heat storage separated from their collectors, but their storage is also separated from the living space. Stored heat can be used when required: a heat exchanger can extract solar heat from a water storage tank in a water-heating system, and in an air-heating system a distribution fan can blow solar-heated air from a rockbed. More important, when heat isn't needed, it can remain in storage. But in a direct-gain passive house, the heat storage isn't separated from the living space. If the floor of your direct-gain house gets too hot or too cold, so do you.
As we look at other types of passive solar heating besides the direct-gain system, we'll think of them as having either a diode function or a control function. Diode is a term borrowed from electronics, and it refers to a device that lets electric current flow in only one direction. Thus, the diode function of a passive solar heating system lets heat flow in only one direction- into the house but not out of it. The control function, on the other hand, lets stored heat be controlled-distributing it to the living space when and where it's needed.
Active systems accomplish the diode function by separating the solar collectors from the storage. The two are thermally linked only when it's advantageous: when the collector is hotter than the storage. An active system accomplishes the control function by separating the storage from the living space. The two are thermally linked only when it's advantageous: when the living space gets too cold.

************************************************************************
21. PASSIVE SOLAR: THE DIODE FUNCTION
The diode function-letting solar heat flow in but not letting it flow out easily-can be added to direct-gain solar heating by movable insulation. To do this, insulation is moved in front of the glass south wall at night. One passive heating system, called Drum-wall, has a thick insulating wall that hinges at the ground. At night it is pulled up against the glass to keep heat from leaking out; during the day it is lowered to let solar heat through the glass wall. The system is called Drum-wall because just inside the glass wall is a stack of water-filled drums used for heat storage.
The south wall of a house isn't the only place where the diode function can be utilized. Another passive design called Skytherm uses the roof of a flat house both as a solar collector and as a storage medium. The system stores heat in water-filled plastic bags, similar in construction to water beds. The bags rest on a metal roof so heat from them can be conducted through the roof and then radiated to the living space below. The diode function works by means of large slabs of insulation that slide on tracks over the bags, insulating them at night. The black-colored bags absorb solar heat during the day when the insulating slabs are moved aside by a device similar to a garage-door opener.
Movable insulation doesn't always mean moving big slabs of insulation. In Beadwall, another type of passive solar heating, the diode function works by moving Styrofoam beads. A fan blows the beads into the space between two glass layers on the south wall of a house. When in place, they provide excellent insulation against heat loss through the glass. When the beads are removed by a suction fan, solar radiation goes through both glass layers and heats the storage within. Sometimes large vertical fiberglass or metal tubes filled with water store heat in a Beadwall system.
Not all passive heating systems use movable insulation to achieve the diode function. A system called the Tromb wall (named after its French inventor) uses quite a different technique.  A masonry wall is built just inside the glass south-wall of a direct-gain house leaving a gap a few inches wide between the masonry and the glass. This gap is connected to the living space by holes in the masonry near the floor and the ceiling.
Air in the gap between the glass and masonry is heated by convection from the black-painted wall. The lighter, heated air tends to rise, just as hot air in a chimney rises. It flows out through the upper holes and is replaced by cool air flowing in through the bottom holes. This cool air is, in turn, heated by the wall and flows out through the top holes. Of course, the cool air flowing in the bottom is the previously heated air which has given up its heat to the room. The process of circulation based solely on heating and cooling is called thermosyphon circulation. Instead of a fan blowing air from the solar collector into the living space, the air moves there by itself. Heat moves by transport heat flow, In a process very similar to natural convection.
Heat can be lost by thermosyphon action at night. Air in the gap cooled by the cold night air tends to sink and flow out through the bottom holes and is replaced by warm air flowing in through the top holes. To prevent reverse thermosyphon, as it is called, the top holes are loosely covered by a thin plastic flap. The flap operates like the one in the check valve of our rainwater analogy-it lets warm air flow into the house during the day but won't let it flow back out again at night.
The passive heating systems we've just discussed illustrate the diode function. They show how a direct-gain system can be modified to reduce nighttime heat loss. But that is not to say these same systems can't perform a control function as well. Next, we'll see how these and other passive systems can control solar heat delivered to the living space.

************************************************************************
22. PASSIVE SOLAR: THE CONTROL FUNCTION
The control function in passive solar heating affects both when and where solar heat is delivered to the living space. When considers the timing aspects. Heat delivered when a house is cold is better than heat delivered when the house is already warm enough. Where considers distribution. Heat must be delivered to all rooms in a house, not just the ones that happen to have a southern exposure.
One aspect of the control function is seasonal. For example, the movable-insulation methods (Drumwall, Skytherm, and Beadwall) can also be used to adjust the delivery of solar heat based on the season. Overheating can be reduced by varying the amount of time during the day that the insulation is in place. For example, a Skytherm house might have its heat store collecting solar heat all day in the winter, half a day in the spring, and not at all in the summer.
Seasonal control of solar heat can also be achieved by using awnings and trees, shrubs, or other plants. Awnings and leafy plants shade a direct-gain house in summer when heat isn't needed but let solar heat in during the winter. Since the sun is high in the sky in the summer, an awning generally provides more shade in the summer than in the winter. Leafy trees don't have leaves in the colder months, when solar heat is needed.
Daily control of solar heat is another aspect of the control function. One way you've already learned about to control heat on a daily basis is to use lots of storage. If storage is very large, the house never gets too hot during the day yet it can warm a house all night long. The Drumwall, Skytherm, and Beadwall systems use huge amounts of water storage to reduce the temperature swing and are still able to provide heat overnight.
The masonry wall of the Tromb all system achieves daily control in another way. The outer surface of the wall gets quite hot, but it is separated from the living space by the wall itself. As the wall heats up during the day, heat is conducted through the wall (in addition to the thermosyphon heating mentioned earlier). By nighttime, the wall has become quite warm and continues to conduct its stored heat to the living space. The heat delivered by the wall to the living space is delayed from the late afternoon (when it's not really needed) until nighttime (when it is needed). This delay in delivering heat depends on how thick the wall is-a foot-thick wall seems to be about the best. Once the heat gets to the inner wall surface it is transferred to the living space by radiation and convection heat flow.
The control function may also be achieved on a daily and a seasonal basis by stopping the solar radiation from entering a direct-gain house. The Sun Window system, as it is called, replaces the glass south wall with a wall of clear plastic which has many passages molded into it. When the temperature inside the house gets too high, a dark-colored liquid is pumped through the passages. The passages are so close to each other that most of the sunlight that would enter the house is blocked. The effect is similar to lowering a window shade on the south wall-except that only the dark liquid moves anywhere.
Since the liquid is dark, it absorbs solar radiation. Not only does it keep the sun from entering a too hot house, but the fluid itself gets hot. The hot dark liquid is pumped to a storage tank where it can be used to heat water or the house later at night. The Sun Window system combines the simplicity of direct-gain passive heating with the control function of active solar heating.
Passive systems can also accomplish the control function  by separating the heat storage from the living space. The simplest approach to separating the two is to have a direct-gain greenhouse separated from the house itself. The greenhouse not only houses plants and stores heat but also acts as a buffer between the living space and the direct-gain system. In the late afternoon the direct-gain greenhouse might get quite warm, but that doesn't necessarily mean the living space will get too warm. A small fan can be used to draw in air from the greenhouse to warm the house when required, or vents can be opened to let the warm air flow into the living space when required.
You may have noticed that some of the passive systems we've been discussing aren't strictly passive. The Sun Window method uses electricity to pump dark liquid through the plastic wall, and the greenhouse method can use electricity to blow heated air into the house. In fact, many passively heated houses use active methods when convenient. For example, passive solar houses often use fans to distribute heat from warm south-facing rooms to cooler north-facing rooms. As improved diode and control functions are added to the passive direct-gain house, the distinction between active and passive may become blurred. But after all, the purpose of any system is to provide solar heat as cheaply, reliably, and conveniently as possible, even if it means combining aspects of both active and passive solar heating.

23. THE THERMIC DIODE
The biggest advantage of passive solar heating systems is their simplicity and reliability. Since they don't depend on fans or pumps which wear out or controllers which malfunction, there's less chance of something going wrong. Considering how easy it is for homeowners to forget to change the filters in their furnaces, the simplicity of a passive system is appealing. But passive solar homes must usually be built from the ground up. It is expensive to add, say, a Tromb wall to your house after it has been built. However, some passive systems are suitable for retrofitting-for adding to a home that has already been built. One such system is called the Thermic Diode. The term Thermic Diode comes from its inherent diode function: it stores heat when the sun shines on it but doesn't lose heat at night.
The Thermic Diode is a modular passive heating unit. Modular means that it comes in individual units, or modules, which can be mass-produced in a factory as the collectors of active solar heating systems are. But it is also passive; it has no fans or pumps and requires no electricity to operate. Each module contains a complete solar heating system: a solar collector, a controller, a heat storage unit, and even a heat exchanger. Yet the Thermic Diode is simple, rugged, and reliable. It doesn't even have any moving parts that could blind or corrode.
Functionally, the Thermic Diode consists of two flat tanks separated by insulation. The tanks are filled with water and are connected at the top by a check valve and at the bottom by a return hose. During the day, solar radiation passes through the glazing and is absorbed by the black outer surface of the thin collector tank. Heat is conducted through the tank's wall, heating the water inside. The heated water is less dense, so it rises and flows out through the check valve and into the storage tank. Cool water from the storage tank flows into the bottom of the collector by way of the return hose. As in a Tromb wall, the water circulates from the solar collector to the storage tank by the thermosyphon principle. At night, the collector cools and the water tries to thermosyphon in the opposite direction; but the check valve blocks this reverse circulation. The thick insulation prevents heat loss from storage when the valve is closed.
The check valve can't be a simple flap valve like the one that we learned about in our rainwater analogy. The forces that circulate the water are too minute to open and close a flap valve, especially if the same valve has to work reliably for twenty or thirty years. The Thermic Diode uses a specially designed check valve that has no moving parts. The valve is simply a chamber filled with water with a layer of oil floating on the water's surface. The oil layer is thick enough so that it covers the top of a short tube coming from the collector. When the solar collector is hotter than the storage tank, the water in the collector tries to rise. It pushes up over the top of the tube through the oil; then it flows down through the outlet to the storage tank. But when the storage tank is hotter than the collector, hot storage water tries to rise and pushes oil down into the tube. Since oil is lighter than water, it resists being pushed down into the water-the way it is hard to push a beach ball underwater when you're playing  at the beach. Oil is pushed only a short way down the tube; then it blocks the hot water trying to circulate from storage to the cold collector.
Functionally, the oil valve acts just like a check valve. It lets the hot water flow through in one direction but not in the reverse direction. Coupled with the thermosyphon circulation between the collector tank and the storage tank, the oil valve lets heat flow one way, but not the other. Thermosyphon circulation and the oil valve provide the same diode function that the controller and pump does in the active system.
Heat stored in the storage tank can be used for hot-water heating or for house heating. In hot-water heating, a Thermic Diode has a heat exchanger built into the storage tank to extract heat. As we saw earlier for an active system, it can be used as a preheater for a conventional water heater. Only two pipes need be connected: one from the watermain, and one going to the conventional water heater.
To heat a house by means of baseboard hot water, the heat-exchanger tubes of several Thermic Diodes can be strung together so that the output of one serves as the input to the next. The last tube goes to the auxiliary furnace. For house heating by forced air, the back wall of the storage tank itself can be used as a liquid-to-air heat exchanger. The back walls of several Thermic Diodes are exposed to a chamber formed between the Diodes and the house's wall. Heat flows by convection from the hot storage water through the storage tank's walls, and then by radiation and convection into the chamber. Since the storage tank is flat, lots of surface area is exposed to the chamber, letting the heat flow easily from the stored hot water. The heated chamber air is drawn into a conventional forced-air furnace for additional heating (if needed) before distribution to the living space.
In either hot-water heating or house heating, this passive system separates storage from both the collector (reducing nighttime heat loss) and the living space (allowing heat to be delivered only when it's needed). It performs both the diode and the control functions.

24. REFLECTING SOLAR RADIATION
When we learned about solar radiation we found that it could be reflected by mirrors or light-colored surfaces. If we can reflect solar radiation in our solar collector, we can capture more sunlight. The more sunlight we capture, the more heat we can get out of the collector. This is true whether we are using an active or a passive solar heater.
The simplest way to reflect sunlight into a collector is from the ground. White or light-colored pebbles in front of a Tromb wall system can add one-third more heat. In cold climates, snow on the ground has the same effect, especially in winter when the sun is low in the sky.
Ground reflection isn't too important in roof-mounted collectors, especially those with a low tilt angle.  Reflectors-mirrorlike surfaces often made of plastic film with a shiny coating-are used to increase the solar radiation that normally falls on a roof-mounted collector. Reflectors are cheaper than collectors, so there's a cost advantage in adding reflectors to a system. A disadvantage is that the reflectors need to be adjusted regularly, though perhaps only from month to month. One system, called Pyramidal Optic Condenser, uses the roof peak of a house to hold reflectors. One of the reflectors is adjusted to capture both the low winter sun and the high summer sun.
The rainwater analogy to a reflector is a sheet which catches some extra rain and lets it pour into the rainwater tray. Since more rain is captured, more will flow down the pipe. But even though we're capturing more rainwater, the leak doesn't get any bigger. Losses are the same with or without the reflected rainwater. Similarly, reflectors add heat (via solar radiation), but only collectors lose heat. In the system just discussed, the  collectors cover only about half of the area normally needed to heat a house. Heat loss from the collectors is cut by half, yet the reflectors insure that the same amount of solar radiation is absorbed by the collectors.
Passive systems can also use reflectors. One method, called Sun Louvers, uses venetian blind louvers with a shiny upper surface to reflect sunlight onto the ceiling of a house or apartment. Ceiling tiles filled with phase change material absorb the reflected solar radiation. As you may recall, phase change materials store heat without getting hot, so overheating is less of a problem. The phase change material melts as it absorbs solar radiation. Later at night, the melted phase change material solidifies and gives off heat.
Reflectors are also important in solar air-conditioning. It may seem strange that solar heat can be used for cooling. However, using thermodynamic principles, heat can be used to condense a vapor into a liquid. When the liquid evaporates again into a vapor it extracts heat-that is, it cools. You feel cold when you get out of the shower because the water evaporating from your skin has a cooling effect.
Most of the thermodynamic cycles used for cooling need heat at a very high temperature-200 F or more. The collectors we've discussed so far may get that hot, but their efficiency is very low. Ordinary glazing isn't good enough to yield high efficiency at these high temperatures; heat losses must be further reduced.
The collectors for solar air-conditioning, called evacuated- tube collectors, cut heat loss in two ways. First, the absorbing surfaces are surrounded by a tube-shaped vacuum jacket similar to a fluorescent light bulb. The vacuum jacket completely eliminates convection heat loss, since no air surrounds the absorbing surface. Second, the absorbing surfaces are made very small to reduce radiation heat loss-small areas lose less heat than large ones. Reflectors are placed behind the evacuated tubes, letting the smaller absorbing surfaces receive as much solar radiation as a larger surface would.
Heat is removed from the absorbing surfaces by conduction to tubes through which a liquid is pumped. The liquid often must be a special one that won't boil at a high temperature. So little heat is lost that these collectors achieve reasonably high efficiency even though they operate at very high temperatures; they are well suited to operating air-conditioning equipment.
Using solar heat for air-conditioning should be a good match. The cooling is needed only when the sun is out; storing heat for nighttime use isn't necessary. However, the extra complication of reflectors, vacuum-jacketed collectors, and heat-driven air conditioners can offset the cost of storage. Nevertheless, evacuated-tube collectors can help cool buildings in many hot climates such as the Southwest; they are also effective in cooling many larger buildings such as stores in shopping centers.

25. WHICH SOLAR HEATER
Now you've learned about all kinds of solar heating systems. Active water-heating systems have pumps that transport hot water and heat from a solar collector; heat is stored in a water tank. Active air-heating systems have fans that force air through ducts in the collectors and transport the heat to a rockbed heat store. In passive water-heating systems, the sun heats water without the use of pumps. For example, the Skytherm method uses movable insulation to prevent nighttime heat loss from solar-heated bags of water. Passive air-heating systems use the sun's energy to heat a house without using fans. The Tromb wall system is typical: thermosyphon action transports heat to the house by day, and a masonry wall delivers heat to the house at night.
Which of these systems is best? Which is best suited for the cold Northeast? for the sunny Southwest? While many factors are involved, perhaps the most important factory is economic:  how much a certain method costs versus how much money it delivers. As you learned in Chapter 1, you pay an initial cost (sometimes called first cost) for a solar heater when it is installed, and you hope it will pay for itself, or even make money for you.
Imagine two empty jars on a balance scale. When you pay the initial cost of a solar heating system, it is like filling up one of the jars. The water in the jar represents your initial investment.  You'd add water to represent the cost of the solar heater itself and the cost of installation (usually one-third of the total). Then you would take out the amount that represented the tax credits your state and federal governments give you to go solar (one-fourth or more of the total). At this point, you've invested a lot of money in a solar heater, and you've gotten no benefit from it at all.
Over the next few years, however, you will save some money each year on your heating bills. The auxiliary unit won't be running all the time because some part of the heat you use will be solar heat. But you will also be paying out some money each year to maintain the solar heater in good operating condition, and possibly to pay interest on a loan you took out to buy it in the first place. We can add some water to the other jar each year to represent the net income from the solar heater: savings in fuel minus interest and cost of maintenance.
If the cost of fuel went up-as it seems to do each year-then each year your net income would be more. If the solar heater had a major malfunction and all the solar collectors had to be replaced, the net income would be much less. Either way the solar heater would be a loss, since the income over the last few years still wouldn't equal the initial cost.
After a few more years your solar heater would start making money. Each year you would add water to the net-income jar until the net-income jar outweighed the initial-cost jar. Thereafter you'd make money on your solar heater.
Trying to trade off these factors-solar heater cost, installation cost, maintenance cost, and fuel savings-is usually a very difficult process. And although cost alone is an important factor, it is not the only important one. Others are risk (will a solar heater last?), appearance (will it look ugly?), and convenience (will the house be cold in the morning?).
To understand how all these factors combine, think of conventional heating systems. In the United States, most houses are heated by natural gas, oil, or electric heaters. Electric  heating is by far the most expensive fuel; the same amount of heat produced by electricity costs twice as much as heat produced by oil. Oil and natural gas heat cost about the same, although gas heat is still a little cheaper than oil heat. But in spite of the high operating cost of electricity, it is very cheap to install, requires virtually no maintenance, and is very convenient (allowing individual room thermostats, for example). Oil or gas heating, while yielding significant fuel savings compared with electric heating, have a higher initial cost, are difficult to install (there are lots of water pipe, or air ducts), require more maintenance, probably won't last as long, and aren't as convenient. You might be surprised to know that despite the fuel savings of natural gas and oil, about half of the housing units being built today are electrically heated.
The decision as to which kind of solar heater to buy is similar to the decision as to which kind of conventional heater to buy. There are similar trade-offs between fuel savings, installation  cost, maintenance cost, and the cost of the heating system itself. Just as no single conventional heating system is best, perhaps no single solar heater is best. Each type of system must find its own niche: a climate, a building style, or even a lifestyle that makes one system more suitable for you than another.
