After a rain you may have seen puddles along the sidewalk, or in empty lots. Perhaps you
threw a small rock or pebble into the puddle and saw something interesting. Ripples or waves
formed in tiny circles around the spot where the pebble hit the water, then spread out into
ever larger circles until the small waves reached the rim, or edge, of the puddle.

You don't have to wait for the next rain to have a puddle if you wish to experiment. Simply
close the drain in the kitchen sink, and turn on the cold water. Get about one or two inches
of water in the sink. Instead of using the sink, you may use a big pan with one or two inches
of water in it.

Now drop a penny, button or any small object into the water and see what happens.

When the penny hits, it pushes against the water. This push, or disturbance, or motion going
through the water is called a wave. It goes out in all directions.

We can't see sound waves, but they act like water waves.

You know a fire engine is roaring down the street, even without looking, because the horn or
siren of the fire engine is vibrating or pushing against the air. This push going through
the air is what we call sound. When this push hits your eardrum, you hear. Hearing is the
result of sound hitting your eardrum.
