Perhaps you have thrown a rubber ball against a cement sidewalk, or a brick wall, and noticed that the ball bounced back.
If you threw the ball into a pillow, it would not bounce back.
Sound does much the same thing. 
It will bounce back, or be reflected, from a hard surface, such as walls of concrete, brick, and rock.
When sound hits a soft surface such as curtains, rugs, and cloth draperies, it does not bounce back.
The secret: bounced sound waves, which we call echoes.
