;;;Perhaps you have thrown a rubber ball against a cement sidewalk, or a brick wall, and noticed
;;;that the ball bounced back. If you threw the ball into a pillow, it would not bounce back.

A ball is thrown at a sidewalk.
When the ball hits the sidewalk, the ball bounces back.
The ball is thrown at a pillow.
When the ball hits the pillow, the ball stops.


;;;Sound does much the same thing. It will bounce back, or be reflected, from a hard surface,
;;;such as walls of concrete, brick, and rock. When sound hits a soft surface such as curtains,
;;;rugs, and cloth draperies, it does not bounce back.

A sound is like the ball.
When the sound hits a hard surface, it bounces back.
When the sound hits a soft surface, the sound stops.

;;;The secret: bounced sound waves, which we call echoes.
