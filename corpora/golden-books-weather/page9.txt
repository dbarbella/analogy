The atmosphere as a thermostat controls the earth's heat as automatically as in any heating system.
It protects the earth from too much solar radiation during the day, and screens out dangerous rays.
It acts as an insulating blanket which keeps most of the heat from escaping at night.
Without its thick atmosphere the earth would experience temperatures like the moon's.
The moon's surface temperature reaches the boiling point of water (212 degrees Fahrenheit) during the two-week lunar day.
It drops to 238 degrees Fahrenheit below zero during the long lunar night.

The earth cools faster on bright clear nights than on cloudy nights, because an overcast sky reflects a large amount of heat back to earth, where it is once again re-absorbed.

Atmosphere moderates daytime temperatures and retards night heat loss.
Night clouds trap the earth's heat.
On a clear night more heat escapes.
