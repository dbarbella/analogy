Heat and air movements.
The air is heated mainly by contact with the warm earth.
When air is warmed, it expands and becomes lighter.
A layer of air, warmed by contact with the earth, rises and is replaced by colder air which flows in and under it.
This cold air, in turn, is warmed and rises, and it, too, is replaced by colder air.
Such a circulating movement of warm and cold fluids is called "convection".
You can see convection currents if you drop small bits of paper into a glass container in which water is being heated.

The air at the equator receives much more heat than the air at the poles.
So warm air at the equator rises and is replaced by colder air flowing in from the north and south. 
The warm, light air rises and moves poleward high above the earth.
As it cools, it sinks, replacing the cool surface air which has moved toward the equator.
If the earth did not rotate, the air would circulate as shown.  
Because the earth does rotate, the circulation is different.
