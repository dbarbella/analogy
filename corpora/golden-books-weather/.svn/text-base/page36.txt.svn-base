Air consists mainly of gases that will not directly sustain life.
Oxygen, which all living things need, makes up slightly less than 21 per cent of the air.
Inert nitrogen makes up 78 per cent.
The remainder of the gases, all totalling less than one per cent, are carbon dioxide, argon, neon, radon, helium, krypton, xenon, hydrogen, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone (a form of oxygen).
Besides these, air contains up to 4 per cent water vapor, also dust and gases such as smoke, salt, other chemicals from sea spray or industry, carbon monoxide, and micro-organisms.

If the air were perfectly quiet, the heavier particles and gases would settle close to the earth and the lightest would be found the farthest out from the earth's surface.
But the constant motion of the air near the surface mixes the gases so that the same proportions exist from the earth's surface up to about 45 miles.  
Farther out are found chiefly the lighter gases.  
Probably only the lightest gases, helium and hydrogen, are found at heights above 500 miles.
In intermediate levels are found high concentrations of ozone and ionized nitrogen, together with smaller quantities of other ionized gases.
