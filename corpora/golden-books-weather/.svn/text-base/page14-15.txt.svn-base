How clouds are formed.
When air is cooled below its saturation point the water vapor in it condenses to form clouds.
When water vapor at a teakettle spout is cooled by the air around it, a small cloud forms.
Your warm moist breath forms a miniature cloud when it hits the cold winter air.
The clouds you see nearly every day form in several ways but all form by the same general process -- cooling of air below its saturation point.

Earth radiates heat rapidly on clear nights.
Air in contact with cold earth may cool below its saturation point and form low clouds, or fog (a cloud on the ground).

Warm air may move over a cold surface and be cooled below its saturation point.
Clouds may form as warm lake or ocean air moves in over a cooler land surface.

Warm air is often lifted by a heavier mass of cold air which pushes under it like a wedge.
Clouds form as warm air cools below its saturation point.

Air may be heated by contact with the earth's warm surface.
It expands, becomes lighter, and rises (convection).
Expansion lowers its temperature.
As it rises, it cools -- at a rate of about 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit for each 1000 feet of rise.
This "adiabatic cooling" occurs whenever air rises.
Most clouds form because of adiabatic cooling.

Air moving up a slope loses heat adiabatically as it rises.
If it rises enough to cool below its saturation point, clouds will form.

Warm air often pushes over a mass of cold air.
Clouds may form as it cools adiabatically because of its rise.

Sometimes rain or snow from high clouds may fall through warm air, cool it, and cause lower clouds to form.
These lower clouds will generally be in layers -- often in several layers.
