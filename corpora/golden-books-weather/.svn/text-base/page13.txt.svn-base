Heat and atmospheric water.
Heat evaporates millions of tons of water into the air daily.
Lakes, streams, and oceans send up a steady stream of water vapor.
An amazing amount of water transpires from the leaves of green plants.
A single apple tree may move 1800 gallons of water into the air in a six-month growing season.

As moist warm air rises, it slowly cools.
Finally it cools so much that its relative humidity reaches 100 per cent.
Clouds form and, under certain conditions, rain or snow comes down.
This external process of evaporation, condensation, and precipitation is called the water cycle.
