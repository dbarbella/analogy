A full understanding of the weather requires knowledge of the atmosphere.
We live at the bottom of a virtual ocean of air.
Extending upwards perhaps 1000 miles, this massive, restless ocean is far different, and far more tempestuous, than the watery oceans that cover three-fourths of the globe.
A narrow band of compacted air lying just above the earth is the region of continuous winds.
Here, the rising and falling air currents sometimes develop into violent storms.
Only since 1960 have advanced aircraft flown above the highest parts of this thin layer, some 5 to 11 miles thick.

The ocean of air differs in one major way from an ocean of water.
Water is nearly incompressible.
A cubic foot of water on an ocean bottom weighs much the same as a cubic foot near the surface.
But the air of the atmospheric ocean is highly compressible.
A cubic foot of air at the surface weighs billions of times as much as a cubic foot at the outer edge of the atmosphere.
The atmosphere thins so rapidly as one leaves the earth that, only 3.5 miles up, over half of the atmosphere by weight would like below you.
It is chiefly in this 3.5 mile blanket of heavy air that weather changes are born.
The atmosphere 500 miles out is so thin that there are only about 22 million molecules of air per cubic inch, compared to billions upon billions at the earth's surface.
Still farther out, the ever-thinning atmosphere blends with the stray gases and dust of outer space.
