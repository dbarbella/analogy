The atmosphere consists of five layers.
First and most important is the troposphere, which lies closest to the earth.
Next above is the stratosphere.
Where the troposphere ends and the stratosphere begins is a boundary called the tropopause, which averages 5 miles above the earth near the poles, and 11 miles above at the equator.
The stratosphere goes up to about 30 miles.
Above this is the mesosphere, extending to about 50 miles.
The atmosphere above contains layers of ionized particles that reflect long radio waves back to earth.
At about 500 miles the exosphere starts; little is known about this layer.
