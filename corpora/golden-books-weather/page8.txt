The glass of a greenhouse lets the short solar rays pass through.
These are absorbed by objects inside and are re-radiated as long heat rays.
But these long heat rays cannot get through the glass.
The heat rays are continually re-absorbed an re-radiated inside.
This helps keep the greenhouse warm on cold days.
Some heat is lost by conduction through the glass.

Like a greenhouse, the earth's atmosphere admits most of the solar radiation.
When this is absorbed by the earth's surface, it is re-radiated as heat waves, most of which are trapped by water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Thus the earth is kept warm.
