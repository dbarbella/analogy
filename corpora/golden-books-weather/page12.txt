Water in the Atmosphere.
Water is always present in the air.
It evaporates from the earth, of which 70.8 per cent is covered with water.
In the air, water exists in three states: solid, liquid, and invisible vapor.
The amount of water vapor in the air is called the "humidity".
The "relative humidity" is the amoutn of vapor the air is holding expressed as a percentage of the amount of the air could hold at that particular temperature.
Warm air can hold more water than cold.
When air with a given amount of water vapor cools, its relative humidity goes up.
When the air is warmed, its relative humidity drops.

As the table below shows, Air at 86 degrees Fahrenheit is "saturated" when it holds 30.4 grams of water vapor per cubic meter.  
(In other words, it has a relative humidity of 100 per cent; it has reached its dew point.)
But air at 68 degrees Fahrenheit is saturated when it holds only 17.3 grams per cubic meter.
That's a difference of 13.1 grams per cubic meter.
So every cubic meter of 86 degree saturated air that is cooled to 68 degrees will lose 13.1 grams of water vapor.
This water vapor becomes cloud droplets which, if conditions are right, will fall as rain or snow.
