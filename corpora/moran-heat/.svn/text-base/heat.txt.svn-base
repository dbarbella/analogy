Transport of Heat

In response to unequal rates of radiational heating and radiational cooling within the Earth-atmosphere system, air temperature varies from one 
place to another. (In Chapter 4, we examine the nature and implications of these imbalances in radiational heating and cooling rates.) A 
change in temperature with distance is known as a temperature gradient.  A familiar temperature gradient is between the hot equator and the 
cold poles (a horizontal temperature gradient).  Another is the temperature gradient between the relatively mild Earth's surface and the 
relatively cold tropopause (a vertical temperature gradient).

In response to a temperature gradient, heat flows in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics.  Simply put, this law states that all 
systems tend toward disorder. You probably have personal experience with some implications of the second law.  For example, if you avoid 
cleaning up your home or room, it rapidly becomes more and more disorganized.  The presence of a gradient of' any kind within a system 
signals order within that system.  Hence, as a system tends toward disorder, gradients are eliminated.  The second law predicts that where a 
temperature gradient exists, heat flows in a direction so as to erase the gradient, that is, heat flows from locations of higher temperature toward 
locations of lower temperature.  In addition, the greater the temperature difference (that is, the steeper the temperature gradient). the more 
rapid is the rate of heat flow.

In response to temperature gradients within the Earth-atmosphere system, heat is transferred via conduction, convection, and radiation.


CONDUCTION

Conduction occurs within a substance or between substances that are in direct physical contact.  With conduction, the kinetic energy of atoms 
or molecules (that is, heat) is transferred by collisions between neighboring atoms or molecules.  This is why a metal spoon heats up when 
placed in a steaming cup of coffee.  As the more energetic molecules of the hot coffee collide with the less energetic atoms of the cooler spoon, 
some kinetic energy is transferred to the atoms of the spoon.  These atoms then transmit some of their heat energy, via collisions, to their 
neighboring atoms, so heat is eventually conducted up the handle of the spoon and the handle becomes hot to the touch.

Some substances conduct heat much more readily than others.  As a rule, solids are better conductors than liquids, and liquids are better 
conductors than gases.  At one extreme, metals are excellent conductors of heat, and at the other extreme, air is a very poor conductor of heat.  
Heat conductivities of some common substances are listed in Table 3. 1.

Differences in heat conductivity can cause one substance to feel colder than another, even though both substances have the same temperature.  
For example, at the same relatively low temperature, a metallic object feels colder than a wooden object.  The heat conductivity of metals is 
much greater than that of wood so that when you grasp the two objects, your hand more rapidly conducts heat to the metallic object than to the 
wooden object.  Consequently, you have the sensation that the metal is colder than the wood.
The relatively low heat conductivity of air makes it useful as a heat insulating medium.  Heat conductivity is lower for still air than for air in 
motion.  Thus, to take maximum advantage of air as a heat insulator, air must be confined.  For example, when a fiberglass blanket is used as 
attic insulation, it is primarily the still air trapped between individual fiberglass fibers that inhibits heat loss.  In time, as the fibers settle, air is 
excluded, and the blanket loses much of its insulating value.

A fresh snow cover has extremely low heat conductivity because of the air trapped between individual snowflakes.  A thick snow cover (20 to 
30 cm or 8 to 12 in.) can thus inhibit or prevent freezing of the underlying soil, even though the temperature of the overlying air may drop well 
below freezing.  In time, however, like the fiberglass, the snow cover loses some of its insulating property as the snow settles and air escapes 
(Figure 3.6).

Heat is conducted from warm -round to cooler overlying air, but because air has a low heat conductivity, conduction is significant only in a 
very thin layer of air that is in immediate contact with the Earth's surface.  Convection is much more important than conduction in transporting 
heat vertically within the troposphere.


CONVECTION

Although conduction takes place in solids, liquids, or gases, convection generally occurs only in liquids or gases. Convection is the transport 
of heat within a fluid via motions of the fluid itself. Convection occurs within the atmosphere as a consequence of differences in air density.  
As heat is conducted from the relatively warm ground to cooler overlying air, the air becomes warmer than the surrounding air.  Warm air is 
less dense than cold air so that the warm air rises and cooler, denser air sinks.  The cooler air is then heated by the ground and the process is 
repeated.  In this way. as shown in Figure 3.7, a convective circulation of air transports heat vertically from the Earth's surface into the 
troposphere.  As we will see in Chapter 4, heat is also transported horizontally within the atmosphere; such a process is known as advection.

We can readily see convection currents by placing a pan of water on a hot stove and then adding a drop or two of food coloring to the water.  
We actually see the circulating water redistributing heat that is conducted from the bottom of the pan into the water.  In this instance and in the 
troposphere, conduction and convection work together; heat transported by the combined processes of conduction and convection is known as 
sensible heating.


RADIATION

As we saw in Chapter 2, radiation is a form of energy transport consisting of electromagnetic waves traveling at the speed of light.  Unlike 
conduction and convection, radiation does not require an intervening physical medium: it can take place in a vacuum.  Although not precisely 
a vacuum. interplanetary space is so highly rarefied that conduction and convection play no significant role in the transport of heat from the 
sun to Earth (or any of the other planets).  Rather, radiation is the principal means whereby the Earth-atmosphere system gains heat from the 
sun.  Radiation is also the principal means whereby heat escapes from the planet to space.

As we also saw in Chapter 2, absorption of radiation involves a conversion of electromagnetic energy to heat.  In contrast. emission of 
electromagnetic energy represents a loss of heat.  All objects both absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation.  If an object absorbs more than it 
emits, then its temperature rises, or if an object emits more than it absorbs, then its temperature falls.  At equilibrium, when absorption and 
emission of radiation are equal, the object's temperature is constant.

Radiative equilibrium does not necessarily mean that the temperature stays constant among all the components of the system.  The Earth-
atmosphere system is in radiative equilibrium with its surroundings.  Nonetheless, heat may be redistributed among the components of the 
Earth-atmosphere system (for example, oceans. land, glaciers) so that air temperature at a specified location may undergo significant short- 
and long-term variations.  Hence, global radiative equilibrium does not preclude changes in climate.
