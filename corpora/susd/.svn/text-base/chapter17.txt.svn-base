17. A TYPICAL DAY: AFTERNOON

The midday hours (10:00 A.M. through 2:00 P.M.) are the most
important for solar collecting. During these hours the sun faces
the collector almost head-on. A large fraction of the solar heat
collected in a day occurs during these midday hours. By contrast,
the early morning sun doesn't face the collector squarely,
and the same is true in the late afternoon. In addition, the early
morning and late afternoon sunlight has to pass through more of
the atmosphere on its way to the collector.

Solar radiation is diminished as it goes through the
atmosphere, so less of it reaches the collector during the early
morning and late afternoon. During the midday hours the sun
angle is better, and the sunlight passes through less atmosphere
as well. In fact, in winter, a flat-plate collector can collect
almost as much heat as a tracking collector, which has a
tracking mechanism to keep the collector always pointed at the
sun. Even though the tracking collector can face the early morning
and the late afternoon sun, there isn't much solar radiation
to be collected then anyway. One that doesn't move at all can
collect almost as much heat, yet be simpler and cost less.

A few hours past noon, most of the solar heat to be
stored during the day has been moved by transport heat flow to
the storage tank. The water in storage won't get much hotter,
since little more heat will be added. Enough solar radiation is
still present to heat the collector so that it is slightly hotter than
the storage tank. But efficiency has fallen off: the collector is
much hotter than the outdoors, making losses high. High losses
mean little heat collected and lower efficiency.

In the rainwater system, a heavy rain is still falling-analogous 
to the sun being nearly square to the solar collector. But
after heavy rain for a long time, the storage water depth and the
water depth of the pipe are much higher. The pipe's water depth
is high enough to force much of the rainwater out of the leak.
High leakage leaves little of the incoming flow to go to storage,
so efficiency is lower.

Late in the afternoon the sun faces the collector less
squarely, and less solar radiation is transmitted through the
atmosphere, as we discussed earlier. The net effect of these
factors is that the solar radiation absorbed by the collector falls
off rapidly. But losses are still high, since they are determined
by how hot the water coming from storage is. Eventually the collector
can't absorb enough heat to stay hotter than the storage
tank. When the collector gets cooler than the storage tank, the
controller shuts off the pump. Of course, efficiency is zero when
the pump is off. Any incoming solar radiation that is absorbed is
lost completely through the glazing.

Let's suppose that the heavy rain falling on our rainwater
tray diminishes, just as the solar radiation absorbed by the solar
collector in the late afternoon is reduced. Less rainwater flows
down the pipe, but there's still a lot of leakage since the pipe's
water depth is so high. The reduced inflow can't maintain as
high a stagnation depth in the pipe because so much is leaking
out. When the pipe's water depth drops below the storage water
depth the check valve closes, preventing loss of our carefully
stored rainwater out through the pipe's leak. As soon as the
check valve closes, efficiency drops to zero: all the rainwater
flowing down the pipe leaks away.

Finally the sun sets. The solar collecting system appears
from the outside just as it did before the sun rose that same
morning. The collector, exposed to the cold night air, is much
colder than the heat storage tank. No water is pumped from
storage to collector because the controller has long since
sensed that the storage is hotter. Only the temperature of the
storage water has changed. Whereas before dawn it was only
warm, after sunset It is much hotter.

Similarly, when the rain stops falling on the rainwater
collector, the only difference is the amount of stored rainwater.
The water in the pipe has long since leaked out and the check
valve is closed, preventing loss of the stored rainwater. The net
effect of the rain falling has been simply to store some portion
of the rain caught by the collecting tray. Although some rainwater
leaked away, the storage water depth after the rainstorm is
much higher than it was before.
