6. THERMAL STORAGE

In solar energy heating systems, it's not enough to simply capture
the sun's heat-it must also be stored. While heating a
house during the day is useful, the house needs heat at night as
well. Heat collected during the day must be stored until night.
How is heat stored?
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;Storing heat is analogous to storing volume. If a cylindrical
;;;tank is filled with water, the amount that it holds-the
;;;volume stored-depends on how high its depth is. Similarly, the
;;;heat stored in a substance depends on how high its temperature
;;;is; a hot brick stores more heat than a warm one.

The brick stores heat.
The bucket stores a volume of water.
Storing the heat is like storing the volume.
The volume of the water that a bucket stores depends on the depth of the water.
Similarly, the heat that the brick stores depends on the temperature of the brick.

;;;If a solar-heated house is to be kept at 70° F during the
;;;winter, heat stored at 50° F isn't useful. Only if the temperature
;;;of the storage material is above 70° F can the stored heat be
;;;used to warm the house. Thus, useful heat in terms of room
;;;heating is heat that is stored in a substance that is hotter than
;;;the room's temperature. By analogy, the useful water in a tank is
;;;the water stored above the outlet. Once the depth drops below
;;;the outlet, the remaining volume won't flow out, so it's not
;;;useful.
A solar heating system heats a house, if the heat is stored at a high temperature.
The heat is useful, if the heat stored at a temperature higher than the room's temperature.
The volume of the water in a bucket has utility, if the volume of water reaches above the outlet.
If the volume of the water falls below the outlet, the volume of the water loses utility.

;;;The amount of heat stored also depends on how much
;;;material is heated. The more storage material there is, the more
;;;heat can be stored at the same temperature above room temperature.
;;;Similarly, a bigger tank holds more volume than a smaller
;;;tank when both are of the same depth.
The heat that the brick stores depends on a quantity of the material that is heated.
If the material has great quantity, the material stores more heat.
If the bucket has great size, the bucket stores much water.
If the bucket has little size, the bucket stores little water. 



;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Often the amount of material is measured by volume.
Using volume as a basis of measurement, different materials
can be compared as to how well they store heat. In solar heating
systems, heat is usually stored in water or crushed rock. Water
stores heat somewhat better than does rock. A container of
water can store two to three times the heat as the same-sized
container filled with crushed rock.

Some materials store heat very poorly. Air, for example,
stores almost no heat. A container of air stores one-thousandth
the amount of heat as the same-sized container of water does.

To understand heat storage, consider the following
example. When you turn off your furnace on a cold day, your
house doesn't get cold immediately because heat is stored in
the walls, the floor, and the furniture (very little is stored in the
air). The stored heat leaks out slowly and keeps you warm for a
short time even when the furnace is off. Adobe houses in the
Southwest have very thick walls that store the day's heat well
into the night.

Another form of heat storage is called latent heat storage.
Instead of storing heat simply by getting hotter, some materials
store heat by melting. Ordinary wax is such a material. Let's take
a piece of solid wax. As we heat it, it gets hotter as does any
other material. But when it gets so hot that it begins to melt a
curious thing happens: even though we continue to add heat to
the wax, It doesn't get any hotter. All the heat goes into melting
the wax, and it stays at nearly the same temperature until all the
wax is melted. Melted or liquid wax again acts like any other
material-the more heat added, the hotter it gets.

When melted wax loses heat, its temperature naturally
drops. But when it begins to solidify again it stops getting
cooler. As it solidifies, it gives back all the extra heat-the latent
heat-that was put into it when it was melted. While the wax is
solidifying, its temperature remains nearly constant. Once it has
completely hardened, it once again behaves like any other
material, dropping in temperature as it gives up heat.

Suppose we use wax to store heat. As the wax melts,
heat will be stored. Later, if we want the stored heat, we'd let the
wax solidify again, giving up its latent heat. Materials like wax
are called phase change material because they store heat by
changing phase-that is, by melting or solidifying.

Why would you go to the trouble to use wax to store heat
rather than water or crushed rocks? Because wax and other
phase change materials can store a lot of heat. Wax can store
several times the amount of heat of an equal volume of water
and many times the heat of an equal volume of crushed rock.
Wax itself is fairly expensive to use to store heat. Other phase
change materials are cheaper and don't pose a fire hazard that
wax might.
*******************************
;;;The water analogy to a phase change material is a tank
;;;that has a bulge in its sides.
;;;When the water depth is below the bulge, adding volume only increases the depth, as it would in
;;;any other tank. But when the depth reaches the bulge, a lot more
;;;volume is needed to raise the depth. Extra volume is stored in
;;;the bulge just as extra heat is stored in the wax when it melts. If
;;;the tank is drained the extra volume can be recovered, just as the
;;;latent heat in the wax can be recovered when it solidifies. When
;;;the water depth in a tank is at the level of the bulge, volume can
;;;be added or taken away without changing the depth much.
;;;Similarly, when wax is near its melting temperature, heat can be
;;;added or taken away without changing the wax's temperature
;;;much.

Wax is a phase change material.
The wax is like a bucket with a bump.
The bottom of the bucket is below the bump.
Adding the liquid to the bottom quickly increases the liquid's depth.
Adding the liquid to the bump slowly increases the depth of the liquid.
The bump stores the liquid.
The wax stores the heat, when the wax melts.
The wax stores the heat like the bump stores the liquid.
If the bucket drains, the liquid is recovered.
If the wax freezes, the heat is recovered.
If the depth lies at the bump, removing the liquid slowly decreases the depth.
If the wax is near its melting point, removing the heat slowly changes the temperature of the wax.
