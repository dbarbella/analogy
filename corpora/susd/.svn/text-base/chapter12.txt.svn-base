12. A SOLAR HEATING SYSTEM

Not only do we want to extract heat from our collector, but we
also want to store this same heat to use after the sun goes
down. We can accomplish both purposes by using transport
heat flow. Our simple insulated plate collector can be modified
by soldering metal tubing onto the back of the plate and
pumping water through the tubing.

Using both metal tubing and metal plate is important,
since heat flows easily through metal by conduction. In this
case, the heat flows from where the sun hits the plate to where
the tubing is soldered to the plate. Convection into a liquid, like
water, is excellent, so the heat flowing into the tubing easily
heats the water. Insulation is again used on the back side of the
collector to prevent heat from leaking away.

After solar heat flows into the water, it can be transported
from the collector by pumping the heated water to a heat storage
tank. A heat storage tank is a water-filled tank covered with
insulation to prevent heat loss. The pump transports water from
the storage tank to the collector, where it is solar heated, and is
then pumped back to the storage tank in a continuous cycle. We
learned earlier that transport heat flow depends on how fast the
water is pumped. Let's assume that we've "sized" the pump so
that the water flows fast enough to let heat flow easily out of the
collector and into storage. At the same time, the pump won't be
so big that the power needed to run it will be significant compared
with the heat collected by our system.

To return to the water analogy: we don't want only a high
depth in the pipe of the rainwater tray. We want to extract and
store some rainwater for use when the rain stops. If we use a fat
tube to connect the bottom of the pipe to a big tank, some of the
rainwater will flow into the tank. The tube is fat enough so the
water in the pipe can flow easily into the tank.

The fat tube is analogous to the pump used in the solar
heating system. Just as the pump lets transport heat flow easily
from the solar collector to the heat storage tank, so the fat tube
lets volume flow easily from the rainwater collector to the rainwater
storage tank.

Suppose a heavy rain is falling on the rainwater tray. The
water will flow down the pipe and start filling the tank. Some of
the incoming rainwater will flow into the tank, and some will
flow out the leak. Since we want to store as much rainwater as
we can, we'd like as little as possible to leak away. When only a
small fraction of the incoming rainwater leaks away, we say we
have high collection efficiency. We're efficiently using the rainwater
by storing lots of it and letting only a little leak away. By
contrast, we have low collection efficiency when a large fraction
of the incoming rainwater leaks away and only a small fraction is
stored.

When do we get high collection efficiency and when do
we get low collection efficiency? The easiest way to understand
collection efficiency is to remember that high efficiency happens 
only when leakage is low. Leakage is low only when the
depth of water in the pipe is low-a nearly empty pipe leaks less
than a full one.

In the rainwater collecting apparatus we're discussing,
we could get high efficiency or low efficiency, depending on the
depth of the water in the pipe. For example, if the water depth in
the tank were low, the depth of water in the pipe would also be
low (the fat tube makes sure both have about the same depth). A
low pipe depth means high efficiency: little leakage and lots of
flow to storage. The same apparatus would give us low collection
efficiency if the storage tank were nearly full. A full tank
would indicate that the water depth in the pipe was also high
(the fat tube insures this), resulting in high losses. Of course, if
most of what is coming into the pipe were lost through leakage,
the collection efficiency would be low.

Now that you have some understanding of collection efficiency,
let's return to the solar heater. We'll assume it's about
noon on a bright, sunny day: the collector is absorbing lots of
solar radiation.

When the heat storage tank is cool, then cool water is
pumped through the collector. The sun warms it somewhat, so it
comes out a little warmer than it went in, but on the average the
solar collector plate stays fairly cool. With a cool solar collector
plate, heat losses by radiation and convection are small, so little
heat is lost. Lots of heat goes to storage and efficiency is high.
Similarly, when the rainwater tank has little water in it, the depth
in the pipe is low, so little rainwater is lost through the leak.
Lots of water goes to storage and efficiency is high.

When the storage temperature is hot, the water being
pumped to the solar collector is also hot. The collector, in turn,
gets hotter. But when the collector gets hot, it loses more heat
from its front plate by radiation and convection. Since more
solar heat is lost, less heat is stored and the efficiency Is low.

A hot collector means low-efficiency solar collection. We
learned earlier that the hottest a collector can get is its stagnation
temperature. But at its stagnation temperature its efficiency
is precisely zero-it loses all the solar radiation it absorbs. If the
water pumped to the collector is cooler than the stagnation temperature,
some solar heat can be stored: the cooler the water,
the higher the efficiency. The highest efficiency is achieved
when very cold water is pumped into the collector. The tendency
for efficiency to depend on temperature is an inherent feature of
all solar heaters. It has an important effect on how solar energy
can be applied to various kinds of heating needs.
