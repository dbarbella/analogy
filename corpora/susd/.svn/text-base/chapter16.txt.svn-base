16. A TYPICAL DAY: MORNING

Now that we've examined all the elements of a solar heating
system, let's see how it operates during a typical winter day.
Right now we'll consider only collecting and storing heat; later
we'll see how we use the stored heat. We'll also follow the operation
of our rainwater collecting apparatus so comparisons can
be made between the two at various stages.

Let's assume that both collecting systems begin the day
partly full. For example, in the rainwater collector, there might
have been some rainwater left from previous rain. In the solar
collecting system, we'll assume the heat storage tank is still
warm from the previous day's collection.

In the rainwater apparatus, the check valve has closed to
keep the stored water from leaking out. No rain is falling, and
any water in the pipe has long since leaked out. As for the solar
heater, the sun has not yet risen. The collector, which has been
exposed to the cold night air, is much colder than the heat storage
tank. The heat storage is warmer than the outdoors because
it still contains heat. The controller had sensed that the collector
was colder than the heat storage tank and shut off the pump,
preventing the storage tank from cooling.

As the sun rises, the collector starts to get a little
warmer. But since a south-oriented collector doesn't face the
sun early in the morning, not much solar radiation is absorbed.
The collector will get warmer, but not as warm as the heat storage.
Since the collector is still colder than the storage tank, the
controller won't turn on the pump. Of course, the collector is a
little warmer than the outdoors, so it loses heat through its
glazing. In fact, it loses all the heat absorbed by the collector:
since none is saved, all of the incoming heat is lost.

For the rainwater apparatus to be analogous to our solar
collector, let's suppose that it starts to drizzle on the rainwater
collecting tray. Since little rainwater is being collected, the
water in the collection pipe doesn't get as deep as the storage
depth. No rainwater flows into storage, and efficiency is zero-all
the rain captured by the tray leaks away.

Until the temperature of a collector gets hotter than the
storage tank, no heat is collected. Often on cloudy days, a solar
collector doesn't collect any heat whatsoever, just as when the
sun first rises in the morning not enough solar radiation falls on
the collector to make its stagnation temperature hotter than the
storage tank's. The heat leaks away from the collector as fast as
it is absorbed. The cold temperature outdoors aggravates the
situation, since the incoming solar radiation must further raise
the collector's temperature so that it equals the storage temperature.

As the sun gets higher in the sky, its radiation strikes the
collector more and more head-on, and more solar radiation is
absorbed by the collector plate. Eventually the collector plate
gets hotter than the storage tank. When it does get hotter, the
pump controller senses the temperature difference between the
collector and the storage tank and turns on the pump. With
pump water flowing, some of the heat absorbed by the collector
is moved into storage: water flowing from storage is heated as it
passes through the collector. Warm water from the collector further
heats up the storage tank. Now not all the collector's heat is
lost, since some of it is going into storage.

In the rainwater collection system, let's suppose the rain
increases from a drizzle to a light rain; this is analogous to more
sunshine being absorbed by the solar collector. With more rainwater 
collected and flowing down the pipe, the pipe's water
depth gets higher than the storage water depth. The check valve
opens and not all the rainwater is lost through the leak, since
some is flowing into storage.

In the late morning the sun faces the collector nearly
head-on; and much more solar radiation is absorbed by the collector 
plate. With the pump on, warm water from storage is
pumped through the collector, where it is further heated. It
returns to the storage tank hotter and continues to heat the tank.
The collector always stays a little hotter than the storage tank,
so the controller always keeps the pump on. Efficiency is high in
the late morning. The collector receives water from storage, and
before noon storage isn't very hot yet. When the collector isn't
hot, heat losses are low, resulting in high efficiency.

The rainwater equivalent to the sun hitting the collector
nearly head-on is a heavy rain. The incoming water fills up the
pipe and flows through the check valve into the storage tank.
Since the pipe's water depth isn't too high yet, not much rainwater
is lost and efficiency is high.
