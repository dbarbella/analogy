10. SOLAR COLLECTOR ORIENTATION

A solar heating system has two major parts: the solar collectors
and the heat storage. The collectors capture the solar radiation
that strikes them. As much as possible of this heat is then
stored in the heat storage, and from there it is delivered to the
house.

Solar collectors can be thought of as big nets which
gather the solar radiation that strikes them. Just as a bucket in a
rainstorm collects rain, so a solar collector collects the solar
radiation raining down on it.

If you were trying to collect the most rain you could in a
bucket, you'd hold the bucket at the proper angle to catch the
rain. The open top of the bucket is the rain collector, and you'd
point it toward the rain. If the rain were coming straight down
you'd hold the top level, but if the rain were driven by the wind
you'd tilt the bucket so that the top would still face the rain.
Similarly, a solar collector should point toward the sun to pick
up the most solar radiation possible. How can you tell if the sun
is pointed at the collectors? If a small peg sticking straight out
from the collector leaves no shadow, then the collector is
pointed straight at the sun.

The sun's position in the sky changes during the day as
the earth rotates. In the morning the sun rises in the east; in the
evening it sets in the west. At midday the sun is highest in the
sky, but it is never directly overhead (at least not in the United
States). If you were to face directly south for a whole day the sun
would rise at your left, travel in an arc through the sky, and set at
your right.

The sun's position also changes with the season. In the
winter, the sun is lower in the sky at midday than it is in the
summer. You can get a better idea of the seasonal change of the
sun's position by thinking in terms of shadows. Since the sun is
higher in the sky in the summer, your noontime shadow will be
shorter than it will be in the winter.

The sun's position in the sky changes from hour to hour
and also with the season, yet we want to catch the most sunlight
possible from a flat-plate collector that can't move so that it
always faces the sun. To do this, we compromise so that the
collector is pointed south, whereby it most nearly faces the sun
during the midday hours, even though some solar radiation is
lost in the morning and evening hours. Although there is a best
direction to face a flat-plate collector, depending on the local
latitude (less tilt is needed in the south than the north), a tilted
collector that generally faces the south performs adequately.

House-heating systems usually have a comparatively
high tilt angle, since houses need the most solar heat in the
winter when the sun is low. Hot-water systems need solar heat
in both summer and winter, so they have a medium tilt angle-a
compromise between facing the sun in the summer and the winter.
Solar swimming-pool heaters usually have the lowest tilt
angle. They need heat mostly in late spring, summer, and early
fall when the sun is highest in the sky.
