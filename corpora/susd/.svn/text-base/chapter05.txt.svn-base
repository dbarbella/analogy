5. RADIATION AND TRANSPORT

Radiation heat flow is very similar to convection heat flow in
many ways. Radiation heat flows from surfaces, as does convection
heat flow. Radiation is also similar to convection in
another basic way: the bigger the surface is, the more heat flows
from the surface. Most surfaces lose heat by both radiation and
convection, and it's sometimes hard to separate the two kinds of
heat flow. For instance, the example used to illustrate convection-
a cooling bowl and a cooling mug of soup-applies
equally to radiation. The bowl loses heat quickly by both
convection and radiation because the bowl has a bigger surface
area. Some of the heat flow from both the bowl and the mug
takes place by means of convection, and some by radiation.

However, radiation differs significantly from convection,
especially with regard to solar energy. One big difference is that
convection depends on a liquid or gas flowing by the surface.
With radiation heat flow, the heat leaves the surface even if there
is no gas or liquid around. In the vacuum of space, where no gas
or liquid exists, heat flows from a space satellite only by radiation.
Radiation heat flow is often called infrared radiation. Infrared
film, for example, is sensitive to radiation heat flow; it is
used to photograph heat leaving objects by radiation. We'll learn
more about radiation heat flow when we discuss solar radiation-
a kind of radiation heat flow that comes from the sun.

A second important difference between radiation and
convection is that radiation heat flows from a surface in straight
lines. If you put your hand to the side of a heating coil on an
electric range, you would feel the warmth of the radiation heat
flow. But if you put a book or even a piece of paper between the
coil and your hand, it would block the radiation heat flow. Likewise,
if you're sitting in front of a fire, the radiation heat flow
from the embers is blocked if someone sits in front of you.

As with all heat flow, radiation heat flow depends on
temperature difference. The important temperature difference is
that which the surface sees. In the case of the bowl, the soup's
surface sees the temperature of its surroundings (the room), so
the important temperature difference is that between the soup
and the room. In the case of the hand, the skin's surface "sees"
the coil, so the important temperature difference is that between
the skin and the coil.

Shiny surfaces play a role in radiation heat flow because
they reflect radiation. For example, a thermos bottle is "silvered"
to reflect back any heat that the hot soup inside might
lose by radiation. This trick keeps the soup hot longer. Fiberglass
batting used to insulate houses also has a shiny reflecting
surface to keep heat in.

Radiation heat flow, then, is much like convection in one
way: heat flows from surfaces at a rate depending on the size of
the surface. But unlike convection, radiation heat flow travels in
straight lines and can be very easily blocked from flowing. In
addition, radiation heat flow can be affected by how shiny the
surface is, whereas convection cannot.

Finally, let's discuss transport heat flow. Heat flow via a
flowing gas or liquid is somewhat different from conduction,
convection, and radiation. Suppose you wanted to heat up a cup
of coffee by adding more hot coffee to it. When you add the
coffee you're also adding heat, since the hot coffee has heat
stored in it. Heat is physically transported from the pot to the
cup by transferring a certain amount of hot coffee from the pot
to the cup.

In most transport heat flow, the flowing gas or liquid
moves continuously, not just for a short time, as in the example
of the coffee and cup. To understand this, think again of the
example of a house losing heat through its chimney. In this
case, the flowing medium which transports the heat is a gas-mostly
hot air. But for as much hot air that goes up the chimney,
there must be as much cold air that comes in from outside to
replace it. The cold air isn't so obvious because it leaks in
through cracks in the walls, windows, and doors. Nevertheless,
as much cold air leaks in as hot air leaves. The air, then, moves
continuously: it enters in through the cracks, is heated by the
fire, and flows out through the chimney. As in conduction, convection,
and radiation, the amount of heat flow depends on the
temperature difference. In this case, the important temperature
difference is that between the incoming airflow and the outgoing
airflow-the temperature of the hot air going out the chimney
minus that of the cold air leaking in through the cracks in the
house.

Transport heat flow depends on two other factors besides
temperature difference. One is how fast the gas or liquid is
flowing, and the other is what the flowing medium is. To better
understand the first factor, suppose your house were heated by
hot-water radiators. Hot water flows in one end and out the
other end; how fast it flows depends on how wide you open the
valve. To get lots of heat out of the radiator, you open the valve
so that lots of hot water will flow through the radiator. If you
don't want much heat, you close the valve so that little hot water
will flow into the radiator; it, in turn, will add little heat to the
room.

The second factor in transport heat flow is the flowing
medium itself. Air and water are the two most important heat
transfer mediums used in solar heating systems today. The key
difference is the volume needed. In this respect, water is a much
better heat transfer medium than air. More than a thousand
times more air than water is needed to transport the same
amount of heat. Fans are often used to transport heated air,
while heated water is generally moved by pumps.
