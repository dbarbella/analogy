23. THE THERMIC DIODE

The biggest advantage of passive solar heating systems is their
simplicity and reliability. Since they don't depend on fans or
pumps which wear out or controllers which malfunction, there's
less chance of something going wrong. Considering how easy it
is for homeowners to forget to change the filters in their furnaces,
the simplicity of a passive system is appealing. But passive
solar homes must usually be built from the ground up. It is
expensive to add, say, a Trombé wall to your house after it has
been built. However, some passive systems are suitable for
retrofitting-for adding to a home that has already been built.
One such system is called the Thermic Diode. The term Thermic
Diode comes from its inherent diode function: it stores heat
when the sun shines on it but doesn't lose heat at night.

The Thermic Diode is a modular passive heating unit.
Modular means that it comes in individual units, or modules,
which can be mass-produced in a factory as the collectors of
active solar heating systems are. But it is also passive; it has no
fans or pumps and requires no electricity to operate. Each module
contains a complete solar heating system: a solar collector,
a controller, a heat storage unit, and even a heat exchanger. Yet
the Thermic Diode is simple, rugged, and reliable. It doesn't
even have any moving parts that could blind or corrode.

Functionally, the Thermic Diode consists of two flat
tanks separated by insulation. The tanks are filled with water
and are connected at the top by a check valve and at the bottom
by a return hose. During the day, solar radiation passes through
the glazing and is absorbed by the black outer surface of the thin
collector tank. Heat is conducted through the tank's wall,
heating the water inside. The heated water is less dense, so it
rises and flows out through the check valve and into the storage
tank. Cool water from the storage tank flows into the bottom of
the collector by way of the return hose. As in a Trombé wall, the
water circulates from the solar collector to the storage tank by
the thermosyphon principle. At night, the collector cools and
the water tries to thermosyphon in the opposite direction; but
the check valve blocks this reverse circulation. The thick insulation
prevents heat loss from storage when the valve is closed.

The check valve can't be a simple flap valve like the one
that we learned about in our rainwater analogy. The forces that
circulate the water are too minute to open and close a flap valve,
especially if the same valve has to work reliably for twenty or
thirty years. The Thermic Diode uses a specially designed check
valve that has no moving parts. The valve is simply a chamber
filled with water with a layer of oil floating on the water's surface.
The oil layer is thick enough so that it covers the top of a
short tube coming from the collector. When the solar collector is
hotter than the storage tank, the water in the collector tries to
rise. It pushes up over the top of the tube through the oil; then it
flows down through the outlet to the storage tank. But when the
storage tank is hotter than the collector, hot storage water tries
to rise and pushes oil down into the tube. Since oil is lighter
than water, it resists being pushed down into the water-the
way it is hard to push a beach ball underwater when you're playing 
at the beach. Oil is pushed only a short way down the tube;
then it blocks the hot water trying to circulate from storage to
the cold collector.

Functionally, the oil valve acts just like a check valve. It
lets the hot water flow through in one direction but not in the
reverse direction. Coupled with the thermosyphon circulation
between the collector tank and the storage tank, the oil valve lets
heat flow one way, but not the other. Thermosyphon circulation
and the oil valve provide the same diode function that the controller
and pump does in the active system.

Heat stored in the storage tank can be used for hot-water
heating or for house heating. In hot-water heating, a Thermic
Diode has a heat exchanger built into the storage tank to extract
heat. As we saw earlier for an active system, it can be used as a
preheater for a conventional water heater. Only two pipes need
be connected: one from the watermain, and one going to the
conventional water heater.

To heat a house by means of baseboard hot water, the
heat-exchanger tubes of several Thermic Diodes can be strung
together so that the output of one serves as the input to the
next. The last tube goes to the auxiliary furnace. For house
heating by forced air, the back wall of the storage tank itself can
be used as a liquid-to-air heat exchanger. The back walls of
several Thermic Diodes are exposed to a chamber formed
between the Diodes and the house's wall. Heat flows by convection
from the hot storage water through the storage tank's walls,
and then by radiation and convection into the chamber. Since
the storage tank is flat, lots of surface area is exposed to the
chamber, letting the heat flow easily from the stored hot water.
The heated chamber air is drawn into a conventional forced-air
furnace for additional heating (if needed) before distribution to
the living space.

In either hot-water heating or house heating, this passive
system separates storage from both the collector (reducing
nighttime heat loss) and the living space (allowing heat to be
delivered only when it's needed). It performs both the diode and
the control functions.
