14. GLAZING AND SELECTIVE SURFACES

How do we get both high temperature and high efficiency from a
solar heating system? We need high temperature (130° F) for
house and hot-water heating, but we also want high efficiency
so the system will be economical. If we were only gathering rainwater,
it would be easy to see how to get higher efficiency: we
would try to stop the leakage.

If we simply tied a rag tightly around the leaking pipe, it
would be harder for the water to leak out. With less leakage efficiency
is higher, since a greater fraction of the incoming rainwater
flows into the storage tank.

Remember that the water depth in the pipe in the rainwater
collector is equivalent to the collector temperature in a
solar collector. High rainwater collection efficiency is equivalent
to high solar collection efficiency. If we want high solar efficiency
and hot collector temperatures, we'll have to stop heat
from leaking from the collector; just as we would use a rag to
stop rainwater from leaking out of the pipe.

Glazing is one way to reduce heat loss from a collector.
Glazing is a transparent cover, usually made of glass or plastic.
It is held a few inches from the collector surface by the glazing
frame. Since solar radiation passes through glass or plastic,
almost all of it is still absorbed by the black collector surface.
But with glazing, heat can't escape as easily.

The biggest heat loss, by far, on an unglazed collector
takes place by convection (although radiation losses can be
one-fifth of the total). Convection losses are high mostly
because the collector is exposed to the windy outdoors. As we
have learned, when air blows over a surface, the surface loses
heat easily. A collector on the roof of a house is seldom in still
air.

Glazing prevents heat loss from the collector surface by
isolating it from the wind. The air inside the glazing cover is
"still" air; heat flows from the black surface by natural convection 
rather than by forced convection (the wind). First, some
heat will leave the collector surface by means of natural convection;
then it must flow into the inside surface of the glazing,
again by natural convection. Next, conduction heat flow takes it
through the glazing, and finally the wind blows it off the outer
surface of the glazing by forced convection. You put pizza in a
box for the same reason as a solar collector has glazing-the
box prevents convection heat loss from the pizza.

The glazing also reduces the amount of radiation heat
flowing from the collector surface. Since radiation heat flow is
mostly blocked by glass (and partially blocked by plastic), the
radiation heat flow "sees" the inner surface of the glazing rather
than the sky. The inner surface of the glazing is hotter than the
"sky temperature," so radiation heat loss is less with the smaller
temperature difference.

Another way to prevent heat loss from a collector is to
coat its surface with a selective coating. The coating absorbs
the high-pitched solar radiation just as black paint does, but it
prevents most of the low-pitched radiation heat flow from leaving
the collector surface. These special coatings are called
selective because they react differently to solar radiation than to
radiation heat flow. Usually they're used with glazing. A bare
unglazed collector loses only one-fifth of its heat by radiation,
whereas four-fifths of its heat is lost by wind convection. A
glazed collector, though, has very low convection heat loss, so
the radiation portion of heat loss becomes a substantial part of
the total-about half. By further reducing the radiation portion
of the heat loss from a glazed collector with a selective surface,
the total heat loss of a glazed collector can be cut down substantially.

The net effect of glazing and selective coatings is that
they allow solar radiation in but prevent heat losses from the
collector, just as the rag prevents rainwater from leaking away
from a pipe.

A collector with glazing delivers high temperatures at
high efficiency-exactly what is needed for house heating and
hot-water heating. A glazed collector loses less heat to the out
doors than an unglazed one at the same temperature, just as the
pipe with the rag leaks less rainwater than one without a rag at
the same water depth.

Whether or not glazing is needed depends simply on the
temperature required from the solar heater and the outside
temperature at which it must operate. Solar house heaters and
solar hot-water heaters must deliver high temperatures and
usually operate in cold weather, and they are commonly glazed.
Solar pool heaters don't need to deliver hot water and usually
operate in mild weather, so they are commonly unglazed. However,
pool heaters used in winter are often glazed, and hot-water
heaters used in warm climates (parts of Israel, for instance) are
often left unglazed.
