7. HOUSE HEATING

We know that heat can be transferred by several different
methods and that heat can also be stored. Let's see how all the
different types of heat flow and storage combine together in a
familiar application. Later, when we talk about solar heating
systems, one important use will be in heating a house: the solar
heating system will add heat and the house will lose heat. The
heating losses of a house provide a good example of the way
heat can flow by several methods at the same time.

Before we can talk about house heat losses, we have to
understand house heating. A house's heating system-whether
it is gas, oil, electric, or even solar-tries to keep the house at a
more or less fixed temperature. When the house gets too cold
the furnace comes on and adds heat to the inside of the house.
The heat might be added by means of baseboard electric
heaters, a gas-burning hot-air system, an oil-fired water furnace
delivering heat through baseboard radiators, or any number
of other heating systems. The added heat, by whatever system,
tends to heat the rooms-to increase their temperature. Once
the indoors temperature gets a little hotter, the thermostat
sends a signal to the furnace and it turns off.

Once the furnace turns off, the house slowly loses heat to
the outdoors. It doesn't lose heat right away, because heat is
stored for a time in the walls and floors. When the thermostat
senses that the house has become too cold, it turns the furnace
on again and the cycle repeats. You usually don't notice these
changes in temperature in the house because they are so small.
For example, if you set your thermostat at 70° F, the furnace
might turn on when it cooled to 68° F and turn off again when it
reached 72° F. Room temperature is always moving slightly up
and down-getting hotter and colder-but it always remains
very close to the set temperature.

The flow of the heat is like the flow of the water.

;;;How could we

The water flows into the bucket from a faucet.
The bucket has a hole.

The faucet pumps the water into the bucket.
Similarly, the furnace pumps the heat into the house.

;;;The holes in the bucket represent the way

*** This is almost a repeat sentence, but the source repeats the information.
The temperature of the house is like the depth of the water in a bucket.

;;;While the temperature difference is

*** There's some awkward splitting here, to prevent attachment ambiguity blowup.
There is a temperature of the outside.
There is a distance between the temperature of the house and the temperature of the outside
The distance pushes heat from the house.
There is a distance between the depth of the water and the bottom of the bucket.
The distance pushes the water from the bucket.

;;;The bottom of the bucket is equivalent to the outdoors temperature.

A thermostat maintains the temperature of the house.

;;; Suppose you were to draw a line on the bucket indicating the depth you wanted to hold.
A line on the bucket marks the depth of the target.

;;; If the depth dropped below the line, you'd turn on the faucet.
If the depth of the water falls below the line, the faucet adds the water.

;;; Similarly,

Similarly, if the temperature of the house falls below the thermostat,
the furnace adds the heat.


;;;The faucet adds water to the bucket

The faucet adds the water like the furnace adds the heat. 

;;;When the depth went

If the depth of the water rises above the line, the faucet stops.

;;;Likewise, when the thermostat senses that the house's temperature

Similarly, if the temperature of the house rises above the thermostat, the furnace stops.

Now, remember the water analogy to heat and temperature.
The temperature of an object is equivalent to the water
depth of a tank; the heat is equivalent to the volume of water;
and the heat flow is equivalent to the water flow. How could we
make the water equivalent of a house-heating system? Suppose
we let water pour from a faucet into a bucket that has small
holes in its bottom. The faucet is equivalent to a house's furnace
because the faucet adds water to the bucket just as a furnace
adds heat to a house. The holes in the bucket represent the way
the heat leaks from the house. When the faucet adds water to
the bucket, it leaks out through the holes; when the furnace
adds heat to the house, it leaks out through the walls, doors,
windows, roof, and cellar.

The depth of water in the bucket is equivalent to the room
temperature in the house. While the temperature difference is
what drives the heat from the house, the depth difference is
what drives the water from the bucket. The depth difference is
simply the depth of water in the bucket, since the holes are at
the bucket's bottom. The bottom of the bucket is equivalent to
the outdoors temperature.

Just as the thermostat keeps the house's temperature
relatively stable, you could keep the depth of the water in the
bucket relatively constant. Suppose you were to draw a line on
the bucket indicating the depth you wanted to hold. If the depth
dropped below the line, you'd turn on the faucet. Similarly,
when a thermostat senses that the house is getting a little too
cold, it turns on the furnace. The faucet adds water to the bucket
just as the furnace adds heat to the house. When the depth went
higher than the line on the bucket, you'd turn off the faucet.
Likewise, when the thermostat senses that the house's temperature
is getting a little too hot, it turns off the furnace. After a
while, the water would leak out of the holes in the bucket and
the depth would drop below the line. It wouldn't happen very
fast, because the bucket stores volume and it would take a while
for the volume to leak away. Similarly, the heat flows from a
house through all of its heat leaks, and the house slowly drops
in temperature as it loses heat. When the water goes below the
marked line, you'd again turn on the faucet and begin the cycle
again.

If you were very diligent, you'd be able to keep the depth
pretty close to the line on the bucket by turning the faucet on
and off properly. Since you were holding the depth more or less
constant, the water lost through the holes would be more or less
constant. If you held the depth constant for a long time, say an
hour, the total volume that poured into the bucket would equal
the volume that leaked out during the same hour. Just as the
faucet adds as much volume each hour as is necessary to balance
the water leakage during that hour, so a furnace adds the
same amount of heat that leaks out of the house each hour.

Suppose we set the house's thermostat at 65° F instead
of 70° F. What would happen? Heat losses would be less
because the temperature difference would also be less. Your
heating bill would be less too, because the furnace adds just
what the house loses. Similarly, if you marked another line on
the bucket at a lower level and kept the depth at this lower line,
the water leakage would be less. Since depth differences drive
out the water through the holes, less water leaks out. On the
average, the faucet adds just as much water as leaks out, so you
would use less water at the lower line that at the higher line.

Our country's leaders have urged us to turn down our
thermostats to save scarce energy resources-now you have an
understanding of why it helps.
