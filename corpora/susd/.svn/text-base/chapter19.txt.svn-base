19. AIR-HEATING SOLAR SYSTEMS

So far we've only discussed hydronic, or water-heating, solar
energy systems. It's also practical to let solar radiation heat air
instead of water. An air-heating solar collector is very similar to
the water-heating collectors we've already learned about. Air,
instead of water, is forced past solar-heated surfaces.

Most air-heating solar collectors are made with an
absorber surface with air ducts instead of water ducts attached
to the back side. As in a water-heating collector, glazing prevents 
heat loss from the black absorbing surface. An inlet duct
lets air be blown into one side of the collector, and an outlet
duct lets it flow out the other side. Insulation prevents heat loss
from the sides and back of the air duct.

After solar radiation passes through the glazing, it is
absorbed by the black absorbing surface. Some heat is lost by
natural convection and radiation from the absorbing surface,
depending on how hot it gets-as in a water-heating solar collector.
What is not lost flows by conduction through the absorbing
surface to the air duct where it flows by forced convection
into the airstream and is transported to storage.

In air-heating solar collectors, lots of surface area must
be exposed to the airstream. Often the back side of the absorbing
surface has many fins, as do liquid-to-air heat exchangers
and baseboard heaters. Heat conducted through the metal
absorbing surface is conducted along the fins. With lots of fin
surface exposed to the air in the ducts, solar heat can easily flow
by convection into the airstream.

Storage for an air-heating system is a rockbed-a closed
container of crushed rocks, each about the size of an egg. As the
hot air flows through the crevices in the rockbed, it gives up its
heat to the rocks. The rocks heat up and the air cools. If much
smaller rocks are used, it's hard for the air to flow through the
crevices; if much larger rocks are used, they don't heat up thoroughly.
Heat in the rockbed stratifies; the rocks higher up are
hotter than those near the bottom of the bed. Air coming from
the bottom of the rockbed is cooler than the solar-heated air
entering the top.

Functionally, the air-heating system works almost
exactly the same as a water-heating system does. Solar heat is
transmitted through the glazing and is absorbed by the black
absorbing surface. The heat is conducted from the absorber surface 
and convected by air flowing through air ducts. Similarly, in
a hydronic system, heat is also conducted from the absorber
surface but is convected by water pumped through tubes. In
both types of collector, heat is lost from the absorbing surface
by means of radiation and convection, depending on how hot
the surface gets. The heat that isn't lost is transported to
storage by either air or water. As in a water-heating system,
storage increases in temperature as heat is added. Cooler air
(rather than cooler water) is blown (rather than pumped) back to
the collector. Efficiency-the fraction of the incoming solar
radiation going to storage-still depends on the collector temperature:
a hot collector gives low efficiency and a cool collector
gives high efficiency.

As in a water-heating system, a controller detects when
the temperature of the air leaving the solar collector is hotter
than the air entering it. The controller turns on the fan when heat
can be extracted from the sun, and it turns it off at night or on
cloudy days when no useful solar heat is available.

All in all, air-heating systems function much the way
water-heating systems do. In fact, the systems are so similar
that the rainwater analogy can represent both. However, although 
they are functionally similar, there are important differences
in the design of the two types of systems.

One way solar air-heating collectors differ from water-heating
ones is in temperature rise. Temperature rise is the difference
between how hot the air is going into the collector and
how hot it is coming out. Since air doesn't transport heat as well
as water does, air flowing through a collector tends to heat up
more. If the same amount of air and water were flowing into their
respective collectors at the same temperature, the air would
come out hotter than the water. If the air comes out hotter, then
the average collector temperature would be hotter too-and a
hot collector means low efficiency.

Fortunately, air-heating systems don't have low efficiency,
since the air blowing into them is cooler. Because of the
stratified effect mentioned earlier, air flowing into the collector
comes from the rockbed fairly cool. Cool air entering the solar
collector tends to lower the collector's temperature and to
improve efficiency. The improvement due to the cool inlet of air
from the rockbed offsets the reduced efficiency of a big temperature
rise through the collector: the air starts off cooler but gets
hotter. The net effect is that an air-heating system is just as efficient
as a water-heating system.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using an
air-heating system? Generally, air systems are best for house
heating, while hydronic systems can be used for house heating,
hot-water heating, and pool heating. Although it is possible to
make an air-heating hot-water heater or pool heater (using an
air-to-liquid heat exchanger), it is usually too costly to be
practical.

For house heating, an air-heating system won't spring a
leak and ruin your rug as a water-heating system might do.
Leaks in hydronic systems can be caused by corrosion of metal
collectors and pipes or by freezing, as we'll see later. Leaks in
air-heating systems won't ruin your rug, but they can mean a big
loss in efficiency. Unless air leaks in ducts and collectors are
carefully sealed, heat can easily leak away. If there are air leaks,
they are very hard to detect.

But the greatest advantage of an air-heating system is
that no freezing or boiling precautions must be taken. Water in a
hydronic system can freeze, rupturing a solar collector's water
carrying passages. Since almost everywhere in the United States
except Hawaii, southern California, and southern Florida have
occasional freezing weather, hydronic systems must have some
type of freeze protection. Antifreeze is often added to the water
as protection against freezing, or drain-down systems can be
installed to drain the water from the collector at night to prevent
it from freezing.

Water can also boil in a hydronic solar collector if it gets
too hot. It probably won't boil while the pump is running, since
the water pumped through the collector keeps it relatively cool.
But if the pump breaks down or the electricity goes out, the collector 
can get very hot. Stagnation temperatures of 300° F and
higher can occur on a bright, sunny day. To prevent the collector
water from boiling, chemicals like glycol can be added, or the
system can be set up to drain the collector automatically if the
pump stops working. In any event, freezing and boiling precautions
can add expense and complication to a solar heating
system that an air-heating system doesn't entail.

What about the disadvantages of air-heating systems?
There are some. First, an air-heating system tends to use more
electricity driving its fans than a hydronic system does driving
its pumps. Second, the ducts needed to transport the heat from
the solar collector to the storage tank and then from storage to
the rest of the house can be much bulkier than the piping in a
hydronic system. Also, the bulky ducts are generally more
expensive to install than are the pipes.

Now that we've looked at solar energy systems that use
pumps or fans to transport heat from collector to storage, let's
look at some systems that are truly solar powered.
