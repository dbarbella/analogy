A solar panel solarpanel005 collects solar rays light005.
If the bucket bucket001 is angled to catch the rain rain001, the amount amountofrain001 of collected rain rain001 is highest.
The top topofbucket001 of the bucket bucket001 faces the rain rain001.
If the rain rain001 falls straight, the top topofbucket001 lies flat.
If the rain rain001 is blown sideways by the wind, the top topofbucket001 angles toward the rain rain001.
