A solar panel solarpanel005 is like a rain collection system rcs001.
A solar panel solarpanel005 collects solar rays solarrays005.
The rain collection system rcs001 catches rainwater water001 with a tray tray001.
A pipe pipe001 attaches to the tray tray001.
However, there is a leak leak001 in pipe pipe001.
Collecting rain rain001 fills the rain collection system rcs001 with water water001.
However, rainwater water001 exits through the leak leak001.
The water water001 leaks quickly, as the rain collection system rcs001 fills.
The leaking water leakingwater001 balances the incoming water incomingwater001, when the rain collection system rcs001 fills.
When the water leakingwater001 balances the water incomingwater001, the water water001 stops rising.
When the water leakingwater001 balances the water incomingwater001, the water water001 is at a stagnation depth stagdepth001.
The stagnation temperature stagtemp005 is like the stagnation depth stagdepth001.
When leaking heat leakingheat005 balances incoming solar rays solarrays005, the heat heat005 in solar panel solarpanel005 is at stagnation temperature stagtemp005.
The solar panel solarpanel005 has reached a stagnation temperature stagtemp005.
