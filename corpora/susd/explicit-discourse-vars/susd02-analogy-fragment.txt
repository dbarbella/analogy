A hot brick brick005 leaks heat heat005 to a cool room room005.
The temperature temperatureofbrick005 of a brick brick005 and the temperature temperatureofroom005 of a room room005 are different.
The distance distance005 between temperature temperatureofbrick005 and temperature temperatureofroom005 pushes thermal energy heat005 from brick brick005.
Heat heat005 leaves until distance distance005 disappears.
A hot brick brick005 is like a bucket bucket001 of water water001.
There is a hole hole001 in bucket bucket001.
The water water001 exits bucket bucket001 through hole hole001.
The depth depthofwater001 of water water001 is higher than depth depthofhole001 of hole hole001.
The distance distance001 between depth depthofwater001 and depth depthofhole001 pushes volume volume001 from bucket bucket001.
After the water water001 leaves, the distance distance001 between depth depthofwater001 and depth depthofhole001 disappears.
When the distance distance001 in depth depthofwater001 disappears, the volume volume001 does not exit through the hole hole001.
The distance distance005 is like the distance distance001.
