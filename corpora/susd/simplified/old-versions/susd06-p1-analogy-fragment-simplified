The brick stores heat.
The bucket stores a volume of the water.
Storing the heat is like storing the volume.
The volume of the water that the bucket stores depends on the depth of the water.
Similarly, the heat that the brick stores depends on the temperature of the brick.
A solar heating system heats a house, if the heat is stored at a high temperature.
The value of the volume of the water in the bucket rises, if the volume of the water reaches above the valve.
If the volume of the water falls below the valve, the value of the volume of the water falls.
The heat that the brick stores depends on a quantity of a material.
If the material has great quantity, the material stores more heat.
If the bucket has great size, the bucket stores much water.
If the bucket has little size, the bucket stores little water.
