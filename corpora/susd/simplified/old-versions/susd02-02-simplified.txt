*A simple analogy to the heat and temperature of an object is the volume and depth of water in a cup.
The heat of an object is like the volume of the water in a cup.
The temperature of the object is like the depth of the water in the cup.

*How deep the water is does not measure the cup's volume.
The depth of the water does not measure the volume of the cup.


*Although the volume and the depth are related-generally, the deeper the water in the cup is, the more volume of water there is in it-depth is a different measure from volume. 
The volume affects the depth. 
A larger depth means a larger volume. 
Depth differs from volume. 


*Also, the depth of the water can be measured with a ruler, but a measuring cup must be used to ascertain the volume. 
You can use a ruler to measure the depth of the water.
A measuring cup is required to measure the volume of the water.

* According to our analogy, depth and temperature are easily measured, so they are like each other; volume and heat are measured only indirectly, so they are like each other too.
The temperature is like the depth, because it is easy to measure.
The heat is like the volume, because it is measured indirectly.

*To see in more detail how depth is related to temperature, and volume to heat, let's consider a few simple cases.
Considering cases elucidates the depth's relationship to the temperature.
Considering cases elucidates the volume's relationship to the heat.


*First, think of two different-sized cans that have the same depth of water in them.
The size of a can differs from the size of another can. 
The depth of water in the can equals the depth of water in the other can. 

* Though the depth of water in both cans is the same, the bigger can holds more volume.
Despite this, the bigger can holds more volume.

* Similarly, if two pans of dirt are heated in an oven for several hours, both will have the same temperature.
Similarly, if a pan of dirt and another pan of dirt are cooked, the pan's temperature equals the other pan's temperature. 


* But even though the temperature of both pans is the same, the bigger pan holds more heat. 
Despite this, the bigger pan holds more heat.

*Just as the depth can be the same while the volume is different, so can the temperature be the same while the heat is different.
The depth is identical, when the volume is different.
Similarly, the temperature is identical, when the heat is different. 

* Second, let's consider two objects in which the heat is the same yet the temperatures differ. 
An object's heat equals another object's heat.
The object's temperature differs from the other object's temperature.

* Two warm bricks could contain the same amount of heat as one hot brick;
The heat of two warm bricks could equal the heat of one hot brick.

* though the hot brick naturally has a higher temperature than the warm ones.
The temperature of the hot brick is greater than the temperature of the warm bricks.

* In the same way, two cans can hold the same volume but have different depths.
Similarly, two cans can have identical volumes and different depths. 

* The analogy is helpful in another way.
The analogy helps in another way. 

* Both volume and heat flow-both can move from place to place.
Volume flows.
It can move.
Similarly, heat flows. 
It also moves.

* When you pour water out of a pitcher into a glass, volume flows from the pitcher to the glass; 
When water pours out of a pitcher into a glass, volume flows from the pitcher to the glass.

* when you open a door on a cold day, heat flows from inside the house to the outdoors.
When a door opens on a cold day, heat flows from the house to the outdoors.
