The brick in the room stores heat.
The bucket stores a volume of the water.
Storing the heat is like storing the volume.
The volume of the water that the bucket stores depends on the depth of the water.
Similarly, the heat that the brick stores depends on the temperature of the brick.
A solar heating system heats a house, if the heat is stored at a high temperature.
The heat is useful, if a material's temperature is higher than the room's temperature.
The value of the volume of the water in the bucket rises, if the volume of the water reaches above the valve.
If the volume of the water falls below the valve, the value of the volume of the water falls.
The heat that the brick stores depends on a quantity of the brick.
If the brick's quantity increases, the brick stores much heat.
If the bucket's size increases, the bucket stores much water.
If the size of the bucket decreases, the bucket stores little water.
