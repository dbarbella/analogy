A bucket is in a rain storm.
A solar collector is like the bucket.
The bucket collects rain; the solar collector collects sunlight.
Collecting the rainwater requires angling the bucket towards the rain.
An open top of the bucket collects the rain. The top points towards the rain. 
If the rain falls straight down, the top lies flat.
If wind blows the rain, the top angles toward the rain. 
Similarly, collecting the sunlight requires pointing the solar collector towards the sunlight.
