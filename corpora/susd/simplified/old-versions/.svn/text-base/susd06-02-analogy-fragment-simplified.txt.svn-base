Wax is a phase change material.
The wax is like a bucket of liquid with a bump.
The bottom of the bucket is below the bump of the bucket.
Adding the liquid to the bottom quickly increases the liquid's depth.
Adding the liquid to the bump slowly increases the depth of the liquid.
The bump stores the liquid.
The wax stores the heat, when the wax melts.
The wax stores the heat like the bump stores the liquid.
If the bucket drains, the liquid is recovered.
If the wax freezes, the heat is recovered.
If the depth lies at the bump, removing the liquid slowly decreases the depth.
Near the wax's melting point, removing the heat slowly changes the temperature of the wax.
