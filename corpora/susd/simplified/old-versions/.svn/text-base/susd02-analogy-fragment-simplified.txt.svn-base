A hot brick leaks heat to a cool room.
The temperature difference between the brick's temperature and the room's temperature pushes the heat from the brick. 
The heat escapes until the temperature difference disappears.
The hot brick is like a bucket of the water.
There is a hole in the bucket.
The water exits the bucket through the hole.
The water's depth exceeds the hole's height.
The water flows from the bucket.
The depth difference between the water's depth and the hole's height causes the exit.
After the water leaves, the depth difference disappears. 
When the depth difference disappears, the exit stops.
The temperature difference is like the depth difference.
