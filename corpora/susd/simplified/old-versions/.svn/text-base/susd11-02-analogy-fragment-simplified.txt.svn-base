A solar collector is like a rain collection system.
A drizzle falls on the rain collection system's tray.
Little solar radiation hits the solar collector.
The little solar radiation is like the drizzle.
Because the drizzle falls, the tray collects little water.
Because the drizzle falls, the intake is reduced.
If the water's depth falls, the spillage is reduced.
If the depth of the water rises, the spillage is increased.
If the intake is reduced, a low depth pushes the intake from the pipe.
If the intake is reduced, the stagnation depth is reduced.
If the intake is reduced, the low depth balances the intake.
If the solar radiation is reduced, the stagnation temperature is reduced.
