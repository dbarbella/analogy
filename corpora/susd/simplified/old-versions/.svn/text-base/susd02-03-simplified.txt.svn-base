
* Why does heat flow?
Consider the flow of heat.

* Heat flows from one place to another because the temperature of the two places is different.
Heat flows from one place to another place, because the place's temperature differs from the other place's temperature. 

* A hot brick loses heat to a cool room. 
A hot brick leaks heat to a cool room.

*The temperature difference-the brick's temperature minus the room's temperature-drives the heat from the brick. 
The heat escapes until the temperature difference disappears.

*Heat leaks from the brick until the temperature difference is gone. 
The heat escapes until the temperature difference disappears.

*No more heat flows from the brick when it becomes as cool as the room it is in.
Heat stops flowing, when the brick's temperature equals the room's temperature. 

*Similarly, a full can of water will leak volume from a hole in the side of the can. 
Similarly, a can of water leaks volume from a hole in the side of the can. 

* The depth of the water is higher than the depth of the hole, so the depth difference drives volume out through the hole.
The water's depth exceeds the hole's height.
This pushes volume through the hole.

* Eventually, all the volume that can leak out does so.
Eventually, the leak of volume stops. 

* When this happens, the water depth has fallen so that it is the same as that of the hole.
This happens, when the water's depth equals the hole's height.

* There is no more depth difference, so no more volume flows out through the hole.
Because the depth difference disappears, the leak of the volume stops.

* Just as a difference in temperature causes heat to flow, so a difference in depth causes volume to flow.
A temperature difference is like a depth difference.
The temperature difference causes heat to flow.
The depth difference causes volume to flow.

* When there is no temperature difference, heat flow ceases; 
When the temperature difference disappears, the flow of the heat stops.

*when there is no depth difference, volume flow ceases.
When the depth difference disappears, the flow of the volume stops.

* The direction of volume flow is always downhill--from a higher depth to a lower one.
Volume flows down.
Volume flows from a high depth to a low depth.

* If two cans having different depths are connected by a tube, volume will always flow toward the depth that is lower.
A thin can and a wide can are connected by a tube.
The depth of the can differs from the depth of the other can.
Volume flows to the lower depth.

* Note that the narrow can has much less volume than the wide one. 
The thin can has less volume than the wide can.

* Even so, volume flows toward the can with the lower depth.
Despite this, volume flows toward the can with the low depth.

* It's depth, not volume, that causes volume to flow.
The depth causes the flow.
The volume does not cause the flow.
