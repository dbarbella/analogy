*The concepts of heat and temperature must be understood before a solar energy system can be understood.
Understanding a solar heating system requires understanding heat. 
Understanding a solar heating system requires understanding a temperature.

*Often these two terms are misunderstood and, even worse, used interchangeably.
The heat is often misunderstood. 
The temperature is often misunderstood.

*However, these words have quite precise meanings.
The words have precise definitions. 

*Heat and temperature differ in important ways. 
The heat differs from the temperature. 

*First, temperature can be measured directly with a thermometer, but heat must usually be measured indirectly. 
The temperature can be measured directly with a thermometer.
The heat can be measured indirectly. 

*How hot something is, is a measure of its temperature, but how much heat it contains is not so easily determined. 
A hot object has a greater temperature.
Heat is difficult to measure. 


* In fact, the heat contained in an object usually depends not only on what it's temperature is but also on other factors, such as what it is made of and how much of it there is.
The heat of an object depends on the temperature of the object.
The heat of the object depends on the material of the object.
The heat of the object depends on the size of the object.

* Heat and temperature differ in another important way: heat costs money. 
Unlike the temperature, the heat costs money.

* When you heat your house for the winter, you buy heat from the local heat dealer--from the oil man or the gas or electric company, depending on how your house is heated.
Heating a house requires buying heat from the utility company.
You can buy heat from an oil company. 
You can buy heat from a gas company.
You can buy heat from an electric company. 


* Whatever form your heat comes in, what is sent to your house costs money.
Heat that is sent to a house costs money.

* The more heat that is sent, the higher the heating bills are.
Increasing the heat increases the bills.

* But you don't buy temperature.
You do not buy the temperature. 

* Temperature indicates how hot your house is, not how big your heating bills are.
A high temperature means a hot house.
The high temperature does not mean increased bills.

*When considering solar energy systems in the pages that follow, always remember that what is wanted is heat, not temperature.
Heat has value.
The temperature does not have value.

*The only way to save money by using a solar energy system is to have the sun pay for part of your heating bill-to provide you with heat.
A solar heating system saves cash, if the solar heating system provides heat.
