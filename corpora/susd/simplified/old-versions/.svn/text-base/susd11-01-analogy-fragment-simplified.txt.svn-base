A solar panel is like a rain collection system.
The solar panel collects solar radiation.
The rain collection system catches rainwater with a tray.
A pipe attaches to the tray.
However, the pipe has a leak.
The water leaks quickly, as the pipe fills.
The spillage balances the intake, when the pipe fills.
When the spillage balances the intake, the water stops rising.
When the spillage balances the intake, the water reaches a stagnation depth.
A stagnation temperature is like the stagnation depth.
A solar cell attaches to the solar panel.
When the heat's leakage balances the incoming solar radiation,
the heat in the solar panel reaches a stagnation temperature.
