Heat leaves a house through a wall.
The wall is like a hole in a bucket.
Insulation for the house is like a reduction of the size of the hole.
A reduction of leakage results from the reduction of the size of the hole.
It reduces the water added by the faucet.
Similarly, the furnace infrequently adds the heat to the house with insulation.
The water added by the faucet balances the leakage.
Similarly, the heat added by the furnace balances the leave of the heat.
