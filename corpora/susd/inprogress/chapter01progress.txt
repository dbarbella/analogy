I. INTRODUCTION AND ECONOMICS

*The sun has been giving energy to the earth for millions of years.
The sun gives energy to the earth.


*Sunlight shining down on plants eons ago was the major cause of the coal, oil, and natural gas we use as fuels today.
In the past, sunlight hit vegetation.
This created fuel.
In the present, humanity uses the fuel. 


*These fuels are called fossil fuels because they are the products of fossils of dead plants.
The fuel is a fossil fuel, because the fuel is made of dead plants. 

* A similar source of solar energy used today is called biomass;
* this term refers to the use of the sun's energy to grow plants which can be used for fuels and other purposes.
Solar energy hits vegetation.
This causes the growth of the vegetation.
The vegetation turns into a fuel.
This is biomass energy. 

* For example, wood used in fireplaces is a form of biomass solar energy.
Wood for a fireplace is biomass energy.

* Researchers are working on other ways to grow plants for use as energy.
Researchers try to grow new vegetation for energy. 


* Seaweed is being grown and harvested for methane production (a gas-like natural gas),
* and trees are being grown for use in power plants to generate electricity.
Researchers grow seaweed for production of methane.
Researchers grow trees for production of electricity.


*The sun also has a major impact on wind and ocean currents.
The sun impacts wind currents.
The sun impacts ocean currents. 


* Different parts of the earth's surface are heated differently by the sun,
* causing circulating currents in both the oceans and the atmosphere.
The sun unevenly heats the earth.
This creates currents in the ocean.


* Ocean currents are rivers of cold or warm water which can be tapped to run power plants;
* someday, these currents may be used to produce electricity.
A current is a river in the ocean.
The current makes electricity.


* Winds have been used for centuries to power pumps and to grind grain.
Wind powers a pump.
Wind grinds grain.

* The sun's radiation may also be used directly to provide either electricity or heat;
* it is used directly as it comes raining down through the atmosphere rather than indirectly by making plants grow or causing wind or ocean currents.
Solar radiation directly provides electricity.
Solar radiation directly provides heat.



* Solar cells convert sunlight directly to electricity.
A solar cell directly transforms sunlight into electricity. 


* These cells are usually made of silicon (a mineral used in the transistors which run radios and pocket calculators).
The solar cell is made of silicon.


* Many of the space satellites circling the earth today are powered by solar cells.
A solar cell powers a satellite.


* Since solar cells are very expensive in terms of the amount of electricity they provide,
* their use to date has been mostly to provide power for remote weather stations where the cost of
* bringing in power lines would be prohibitive;
Because a solar cell is expensive, it is used to power weather stations.
Because the weather stations are remote, a power line are expensive.

* another application has been in powering remote railroad-crossing lights and ocean buoys.
A solar cell powers a traffic light.
A solar cell powers a buoy.

* Heating is the other example of direct use of the sun.
The sun directly heats objects.

* You've probably experienced the heating effects of solar energy
* when walking barefoot on a tarred road on a hot, sunny day.
Sunlight increases the temperature of a road.

* The heat produced by solar energy can be used to power turbines to
* generate electricity, or it can be used to heat buildings or water.
Solar energy produces heat.
The heat powers a turbine.
The turbine makes electricity.
The heat heats buildings.
The heat heats water.


* One system now being developed to generate electricity uses hundreds of mirrors which focus the sun's rays on a central tower;
* a boiler on the tower gets very hot and produces steam, driving a turbine that generates electricity.
A new system is developing.
The system uses an array of mirrors.
The array reflects sunlight onto a tower.
A boiler is on the tower.
The sunlight heats the bucket.
The bucket produces steam.
The steam powers a turbine.
The turbine makes electricity.



* Although the sun's position changes from morning to evening, the mirrors move to
* let the sun's reflection focus on the tower.
* Systems like these are called tracking because they follow the sun from sunrise to
* sundown.
Because the array angles towards the sun, the system is a tracking system.



* Even if a solar energy system isn't designed to follow the sun, the sun's heat can still be captured.
* Solar heating systems which aren't of the tracking kind are called flat-plate systems.
A fixed solar heating system also captures sunlight.
An immobile solar heating system is a flat plate system. 

* In comparison to tracking systems, they are not very sophisticated,
* but almost all of the solar energy systems in use today are of the flat-plate variety.
A flat plate system is simpler than a tracking system.
A flat plate system is more frequent than a tracking system.

* Over a million flat-plate systems are now in operation, mostly in countries with hot, sunny climates
* such as Israel and Australia.
A flat plate system is common in a sunny country. 


* The most common use for such systems is to heat water, but it is also practical to use them to warm a house in winter.
A flat plate system usually heats water.
A flat plate system also heats a house in winter.


* Since flat-plate systems are the simplest and most widely used methods of using solar energy
* today, we will investigate them in detail.

* But first it is important to understand why solar energy has just recently begun to be a
* practical means of providing direct heating.

* If sunlight is free, why hasn't solar energy been used
* before to heat houses and produce electricity? The following
* example will help you understand why.








* Let's suppose you owned a gold mine that contained only very low-grade gold ore.
A man owns a mine.
A gold mine contains poor ore.

* You would have to do a lot of digging before you got even a little gold.
Mining gold requires digging much.

* If you bought some expensive mining equipment, you could process much more of the low-grade ore and get more gold.
Processing the ore requires expensive mining equipment.
Acquiring the gold requires processing the ore.

* Thus, even though the gold itself is free, it would be very costly to get very much of it out of the mine.
The gold is free, but acquiring the gold is expensive.


* You would have to balance the cost of the mining equipment against how much
* money you'd get when you sold your gold. If the gold were very
* valuable and the mining equipment relatively cheap, it might be
* worthwhile to dig up the gold. But if the equipment were expensive
* and the gold not very valuable, you'd be better off to leave it
* in the ground.
Acquiring the gold benefits the man, if the gold possesses great value.
Acquiring the gold benefits the man, if the mining equipment possesses only a little value.
Acquiring the gold harms the man, if the gold possesses little value.
Acquiring the gold harms the man, if the mining equipment possesses only a great value.

* Many gold mines in Utah that have only low-grade ore were closed down years ago;
* some have recently reopened because the price of gold has increased enough to make
* mining it worthwhile.
A gold mine in Utah closes, if the gold possesses only a little value.
The gold mine opens, if the gold possesses great value.

* Solar energy is like the low-grade ore.
Solar radiation is like the poor ore.


*The sun's rays must be "mined," or collected,
Acquiring solar energy requires collecting the solar radiation.


* and then transformed into useful heat or electricity before they are worth anything.
Using the solar energy requires transforming the solar energy into electricity.


* A solar energy system helps you get "free" solar energy, just as the mining
* equipment helps you get "free" gold.
The solar collector collects the solar energy.
Similarly, the mining equipment collects the gold.


* But, like mining equipment, a solar energy system can be very expensive-perhaps 
* more than the sun's energy is worth.
The solar collector is expensive.
The solar collector is more expensive than the solar radiation.

* If conventional energy is expensive-that is, if the cost of
* heating by using fossil fuels and electricity goes up-then it
* might be worth the expense to install a solar energy system. But
* if these forms of energy are cheap, then the cost of installing a
* solar energy system would probably be too expensive. Simply
* put, the cost of the solar energy would come to more than the
* value of the energy it could collect from the sun.
The solar heating system saves cash, if electricity possesses great value.
The solar heating system wastes cash, if electricity possesses only a little value. 


* Just as many gold mines in Utah were shut down when it became too costly to
* mine their gold, many solar hot-water heaters used in Florida
* and California during the 1950s were shut down when the cost of
* electricity was so cheap.
The gold mine in Utah closes, if the gold mine wastes cash.
Similarly, a solar heating system in Florida closes, if electricity possesses only a little value.



* Recently the cost of heating by gas, oil, and electricity has risen so much that solar energy systems
* are once again worthwhile, much as the Utah gold mines have
* once again become profitable because of the rise in the price of
* gold.
Because gold now possesses great value, the gold mine in Utah makes cash.
Similarly, electricity now possesses great value.
Because the electricity possesses great value, the solar heating system saves cash. 

* A solar energy system can be thought of as "mining" sunlight.
The solar collector collects sunlight. It is like mining equipment.

* If mining equipment is simple and rugged, it will give many years of service before it must be replaced.
* But mining equipment can't be too expensive or it will make mining low-grade ore unprofitable.
Mining poor ore wastes cash, if the mining equipment possesses great value.
The mining equipment possesses longevity, if the mining equipment possesses simplicity. 

* Like mining equipment, solar energy systems must be simple, rugged, and low in cost so that they
* will give many years of service without making the sunlight that they "mine" unprofitable.
Similarly, if the solar collector possesses simplicity, the solar collector possesses longevity. 


* This is why the flat-plate collector solar system is being used so much today in countries such as
* Japan, Israel, and Australia: It is a very simple, rugged system whose cost is low enough to make the use of solar energy
* worthwhile.
Because the flat plate system possesses simplicity, the flat plate system saves cash.
