 "We examined the elements of a solar heating system. 
We will examine the solar heating system operating during a typical day. 
Now, we will consider collection of heat and storage of heat. 
After that, we will consider using the stored heat. 
We also compare the rainwater collection system and the solar heating system."

 "At the start of each day, the solar heating system is semifull. 
At the start of each day, the rainwater collection system is semifull. 
The rainwater collection system could have some rainwater in it. 
The solar heating system's heat storage is warm because the solar heating system collected heat during the previous day. 
In the rainwater collection system, the valve closes.
This prevents the flow of the stored water. 
The rain is not falling.
The water in the pipe has leaked out.
The sun has not yet risen on the solar heating system. 
The solar collector was exposed to the cold air in the night.
The heat storage contains heat.
Because of this, the heat storage's temperature is greater than the air's temperature.
The control device sensed that the heat storage's temperature was greater than the solar collector's temperature. 
Because of this, the control device shut off the pump.
This prevented the cooling process of the heat storage."

 "The height of the sun rises.
This increases the solar collector's temperature.
A solar collector faces south.
In the morning, the solar collector is not facing the sun.
Because of this, the solar collector absorbs a low amount of sunlight. 
The solar collector absorbs the sunlight.
The solar collector's temperature increases. 
The heat storage's temperature exceeds the solar collector's temperature.
Because the heat storage's temperature exceeds the solar collector's temperature, the control device does not turn on the pump.
Because the solar collector's temperature exceeds the air's temperature, heat leaves the solar collector through the glaze.
The heat in the solar collector leaves.  
No heat in the solar collector remains.
The solar collector does not collect heat."

 "The rainwater collection system is like the solar heating system. 
Rainwater falls onto the rainwater collection tray.
The amount of captured rainwater is low. 
Because of this, the depth of the water in the storage tank exceeds the depth of the water in the pipe.
Rainwater does not flow into the storage tank. 
The rain captured by the tray leaks away."

 "The system does not capture heat, when the heat storage's temperature exceeds the solar collector's temperature. 
A solar collector on a cloudy day does not capture heat. 
Similarly, when the sun is low, the amount of solar radiation on the solar collector is low.
Because of this, the heat storage's temperature exceeds the solar collector's stagnation temperature.
The rate of heat flow from the solar collector equals the rate of absorption of heat. 
The air is cold.  
This increases the distance between the temperature of the solar collector and the temperature of the heat storage.
This increases the amount of necessary solar radiation.")

"As the height of the sun increases, the amount of solar radiation on the solar collector increases.
Eventually, the solar collector's temperature exceeds the heat storage's temperature. 
The control device senses the temperature difference between the solar collector and the heat storage. 
This causes the control device to turn the pump.
The water in the pump flows.
Because of this, the solar collector's heat moves to the heat storage.
Water flows from the storage tank to the solar collector.
The water is heated in the solar collector.
Warm water from the solar collector increases the temperature of the heat storage.
Heat flows from the solar collector to the heat storage. 
Because of this, heat is saved."

 "The amount of rain that falls on the rainwater collection system increases. 
That increase is like an increase of the amount of solar radiation on the solar collector.
The amount of rainwater in the pipe increases.
Because of this, the depth of the water in the pipe exceeds the depth of the water in the storage tank.
The valve opens.
Because of this, the rainwater flows into the storage tank."

 "During the late morning, the sun faces the solar collector directly. 
Because of this, the solar collector absorbs additional solar radiation.
The pump is turned on.
Because of this, warm water flows from the storage tank through the solar collector.
The water's temperature increases in the solar collector.
The water is hot when the water returns to the heat storage. 
Because of this, the water increases the temperature of the heat storage.
The solar collector's temperature exceeds the heat storage's temperature. 
Because of this, the pump is turned on.
Efficiency is high in the late morning. 
Water flows to the solar collector from the heat storage.
The heat storage is cool before noon.
When the solar collector is cool, leakage of heat is low.
This increases efficiency."
