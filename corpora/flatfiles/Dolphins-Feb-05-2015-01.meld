 "A dolphin's anatomy differs from a porpoise's anatomy.
You can distinguish the two animals by looking at the head and the dorsal fins. 
The dolphin has a beak.
Because of this, the dolphin has a long nose.
The porpoise has no beak.
Because of this, the porpoise has a flat nose.
The dolphin has curved dorsal fins. 
The porpoise has triangular dorsal fins. 
You can also distinguish the two by their teeth.
The dolphin has conical teeth.
The porpoise has flat teeth."

 "Dolphins and porpoises can be many sizes. 
Generally, a dolphin's size exceeds a porpoise's size. 
A killer whale is a dolphin.
It is 35 feet long.
Another dolphin is 4 feet long. 
The porpoise is darker than the dolphin.
The porpoise is 5 feet long.
The porpoise and the dolphin breathe air through a blowhole at the top of the head. 
Like other mammals, the dolphin and the porpoise give birth to live young.
The dolphin and the porpoise nurse their offspring. 
The dolphin and the porpoise have hair. 
Soon after birth, the dolphin and the porpoise lose the hair."

 "A dolphin and a porpoise have three sorts of fin. 
The pectoral fins contain bones. 
They are used for stopping and steering.
The fins contain the same number of bones as a human arm. 
The fins have five digits.
The structure of the digits is like the structure of fingers.
The bones came from an ancestor of dolphins and porpoises.
The ancestor lived on the land.
The ancestor lived many years in the past."

 "The flippers of a dolphin contain digits that are like fingers.
The dorsal fin of the dolphin stabilizes the dolphin during movement.
The dorsal fin of a porpoise stabilizes the porpoise during movement.
A dorsal fin is made of collagen.
The tail is made of collagen.
Collagen is a connective tissue.
It is like cartilage."

 "A dolphin and a porpoise use echolocation.
Echolocation is for navigating.
Echolocation is for finding food.
Echolocation is for communication.
The porpoise lacks a melon.
The melon of the dolphin helps the dolphin with echolocation.
The porpoise has better eyes.
A dolphin and a porpoise have a small external ear.
The ear is behind the eye. 
The dolphin and the porpoise do not rely on smell.
The voice of a dolphin is extensive and frequent. 
It travels further than the voice of a porpoise.
The distance that it travels exceeds the distance of the porpoise's voice."

 "Male dolphins and porpoises have two genital holes on their ventral side.
Female dolphins and porpoises have four genital holes.
The female dolphins and the female porpoises have two holes for sex organs and two holes for nursing.
The female dolphins and the female porpoises have teats inside the body.
The mating season of dolphins and porpoises is short.
The dominant male dolphins and the dominant male porpoises have several mates.
The dolphins often mate for life. 
A dolphin gestates for a year, and a porpoise gestates for a year. 
The dolphin and the porpoise often have one calf.
The calf is weaned after one year."

 "A dolphin lives in a group of a dozen dolphins.
When food is abundant, a group of 1000 dolphins forms. 
Dolphins use ultrasonic sounds to coordinate hunts. 
A porpoise is shy.
The porpoise lives in a group of a small number of porpoises, or the porpoise lives alone.
The porpoise is rarely in a large pod.
The grouping behavior of the porpoise does not result in stable associations.
It results in temporary relationships. 
The relationships change when porpoises join or leave.
Porpoises coordinate, when they are apart. 
The porpoises use echolocation to find prey.
They use echolocation to stay together.
They do not use echolocation to communicate like dolphins."

 "A dolphin and a porpoise are intelligent.
The dolphin and the porpoise have large brains. 
The dolphin and the porpoise are sapient like a human.
The dolphin and the porpoise can use a mirror.
Scientists have performed research.
The research allows the scientists to argue for protection of porpoises and dolphins. 
Because of this, hunting the whales is prohibited. 
Dolphins call the names of family, when they become separated. 
Dolphins and humans are the only species to call with names.
The dolphins stay with injured dolphins.  
The dolphins help humans at sea.
A dolphin is outgoing.
Because of this, the dolphin lives well in captivity.
A porpoise lives poorly in captivity."
