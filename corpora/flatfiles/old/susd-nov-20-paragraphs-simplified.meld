After that, we will consider using the stored heat. We also compare the rainwater collection system and the solar heating system."

At the start of each day, the rainwater collection system is semifull. 
The rainwater collection system could have some rainwater in it. 
The solar heating system's heat storage is warm because the solar heating system collected heat during the previous day. 
In the rainwater collection system, the valve closes.
This prevents the flow of the stored water. 
The rain is not falling.
The water in the pipe has leaked out.
The sun has not yet risen on the solar heating system. 
The solar collector was exposed to the cold air in the night.
The heat storage contains heat.
Because of this, the heat storage's temperature is greater than the air's temperature.
The control device sensed that the heat storage's temperature was greater than the solar collector's temperature. 
Because of this, the control device shut off the pump.
This prevented the cooling process of the heat storage."
