Look about you. The people in the street, the birds sitting on the branch of a tree, and
even the tree itself-all of these have something in common. They and all other living
things are made up of tiny building blocks of life, called cells.

These cells are so complicated that you need a microscope to see them. And yet they are
much more complicated than wooden building blocks.

Just as blocks can be used to build various structures - houses and bridges and tunnels -
nature uses her building blocks, the cells, the make more than a million different kinds
of living creatures. From tiny cells are made huge whales, larger than a house. But the
cells in a timid little mouse, hiding on a dark corner, are just as large as the cells in
the whale. For it is not the size of an animals cells that makes it large or small, but
how many cells it has.

Plants, too are made of the same kind of building blocks. The giant redwood trees in
California are made of tiny cells, and so is the grass on the front lawn.

But what is a cell? Just as the words of our language are made up of cells, the basic
units of life. And just as there are many letters in the alphabet, there are many kinds of
cells. They have different sizes and shapes, and they have different functions.
