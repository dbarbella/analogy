Although most cells are smaller than a pin, each is a busy factory. There are thousands of
different chemicals in a cell, and each one seems to have a special job to do. Something
is happening all the time. Chemicals are being freshly made, and other chemicals are
passing in or out of the cell through a special wall called the cell membrane.

Just as a factory has a main office, which tells all the workers what jobs to do, the cell
has a "main office" called the nucleus. In this small structure, often buried in the
middle of the cell, are the "brains" of the factory.
