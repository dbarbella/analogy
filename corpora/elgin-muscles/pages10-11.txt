All muscles can shorten, or contract. By shortening, they make various parts of your body
move. To see how this works, take a strong rubber band and stretch it out as far as it will
go. Then relax one of your hands and let the band shorten. Does your hand move with the
rubber band?

Muscles work the same way as the rubber band. When the muscles contract, they move the parts
of the body to which they are fastened.
