1. Since each scale reads 350 N, Lucy's total weight is 700 N.

2. The weight on the lesser scale is 400 N and the weight on the greater scale is 800N.

3. From the equilibrium rule, (SIGMA)F = 0, the upward forces are 800 N, and the downward forces are 500 N + the weight of the staging. So the staging must weigh 300 N.

4. From the equilibrium rule, (SIGMA)F = 0, the downward forces are 1300 N, and the upward forces are 800 N + the tension in the right-hand rope. So the tension in the right-hand rope must be 500 N.
