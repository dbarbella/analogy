In this and many other chapters we will study the ideas of Isaac Newton, one of the greatest minds of all time. Newton was born prematurely on Christmas Day, 1642, and barely survived in his mother's farmhouse in England. His father died several months before his birth, and he grew up under the care of his mother and grandmother. As a child, he showed no particular signs of brightness, and, as a young teen, he was taken out of school to help manage his mother's farm. He had little interest in this, preferring to read books he borrowed from a neighbor. An uncle, who sensed the scholarly potential in young Isaac, arranged for him to go back to school for a year and then on to the University of Cambridge, where he stayed for 5 years, graduating without particular distinction.

When a plague swept through England, Newton retreated to his mother's farm—this time to continue his studies. There, at the age of 22 and 23, he laid the foundations for the work that was to make him immortal. Seeing an apple fall to the ground led him to consider the force of gravity extending to the Moon and beyond. He formulated the law of universal gravitation and applied it to solving the centuries-old mysteries of planetary motion and ocean tides; he invented the calculus, an indispensable mathematical tool in science. He extended the work of Italian scientist Galileo, and formulated the three fundamental laws of motion. The first of these laws is the law of inertia, which is the subject of this chapter.

As background to the physics that Newton so clearly presented, we go back to the 3rd century BC to Aristotle, the most outstanding philosopher-scientist of his time in ancient Greece. Aristotle attempted to clarify motion by classification.

Aristotle on Motion

Aristotle divided motion into two main classes: natural motion and violent motion. We briefly consider each, not as study material, but as a background to present-day ideas about motion.

Aristotle asserted that natural motion proceeds from the "nature" of an object, dependent on the combination of the four elements (earth, water, air, and fire) the object contains. In his view, every object in the universe has a proper place, determined by its "nature"; any object not in its proper place will "strive" to get there. Being of the earth, an unsupported lump of clay will fall to the ground; being of the air, an unimpeded puff of smoke will rise; being a mixture of earth and air but predominantly earth, a feather falls to the ground, but not as rapidly as a lump of clay. He stated that heavier objects would strive harder and argued that objects should fall at speeds proportional to their weights: The heavier the object, the faster it should fall.

Natural motion could be either straight up or straight down, as in the case of all things on Earth, or it could be circular, as in the case of celestial objects. Unlike up-and-down motion, circular motion has no beginning or end, repeating itself without deviation. Aristotle believed that different rules apply to the heavens and asserted that celestial bodies are perfect spheres made of a perfect and unchanging substance, which he called quintessence.) (The only celestial object with any detectable variation on its face was the Moon. Medieval Christians, still under the sway of Aristotle's teaching, ignorantly explained that lunar imperfections were due to the closeness of the Moon and contamination by human corruption on Earth.)

Violent motion, Aristotle's other class of motion, resulted from pushing or pulling forces. Violent motion was imposed motion. A person pushing a cart or lifting a heavy weight imposed motion, as did someone hurling a stone or winning a tug of war. The wind imposed motion on ships. Floodwaters imposed it on boulders and tree trunks. The essential thing about violent motion was that it was externally caused and was imparted to objects; they moved not of themselves, not by their "nature," but because of pushes or pulls.

The concept of violent motion had its difficulties, for the pushes and pulls responsible for it were not always evident. For example, a bowstring moved an arrow until the arrow left the bow; after that, further explanation of the arrow's motion seemed to require some other pushing agent. Aristotle imagined, therefore, that a parting of the air by the moving arrow resulted in a squeezing effect on the rear of the arrow as the air rushed back to prevent a vacuum from forming. The arrow was propelled through the air as a bar of soap is propelled in the bathtub when you squeeze one end of it.

To sum up, Aristotle taught that all motions are due to the nature of the moving object, or due to a sustained push or pull. Provided that an object is in its proper place, it will not move unless subjected to a force. Except for celestial objects, the normal state is one of rest.

Aristotle's statements about motion were a beginning in scientific thought, and, although he did not consider them to be the final words on the subject, his followers for nearly 2000 years regarded his views as beyond question. Implicit in the thinking of ancient, medieval, and early Renaissance times was the notion that the normal state of objects is one of rest. Since it was evident to most thinkers until the 16th century that Earth must be in its proper place, and since a force capable of moving Earth was inconceivable, it seemed quite clear to them that Earth does not move.

Copernicus and the Moving Earth

It was in this intellectual climate that the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473—1543) formulated his theory of the moving Earth. Copernicus reasoned that the simplest way to account for the observed motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets through the sky was to assume that Earth (and other planets) circle around the Sun. For years he worked without making his thoughts public—for two reasons. The first was that he feared persecution; a theory so completely different from common opinion would surely be taken as an attack on established order. The second reason was that he had grave doubts about it himself; he could not reconcile the idea of a moving Earth with the prevailing ideas of motion. Finally, in the last days of his life, at the urging of close friends, he sent his De Revolutionibus to the printer. The first copy of his famous exposition reached him on the day he died — May 24, 1543.

Most of us know about the reaction of the medieval Church to the idea that Earth travels around the Sun. Because Aristotle's views had become so formidably a part of Church doctrine, to contradict them was to question the Church itself. For many Church leaders, the idea of a moving Earth threatened not only their authority but the very foundations of faith and civilization as well. For better or for worse, this new idea was to overturn their conception of the cosmos—although eventually the Church embraced it.

Galileo and the Leaning Tower

It was Galileo, the foremost scientist of the early 17th century, who gave credence to the Copernican view of a moving Earth. He accomplished this by discrediting the Aristotelian ideas about motion. Although he was not the first to point out difficulties in Aristotle's views, Galileo was the first to provide conclusive refutation through observation and experiment.

Galileo easily demolished Aristotle's falling-body hypothesis. Galileo is said to have dropped objects of various weights from the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa to compare their falls. Contrary to Aristotle's assertion, Galileo found that a stone twice as heavy as another did not fall twice as fast. Except for the small effect of air resistance, he found that objects of various weights, when released at the same time, fell together and hit the ground at the same time. On one occasion, Galileo allegedly attracted a large crowd to witness the dropping of two objects of different weight from the top of the tower. Legend has it that many observers of this demonstration who saw the objects hit the ground together scoffed at the young Galileo and continued to hold fast to their Aristotelian teachings.

Galileo's Inclined Planes

Galileo was concerned with how things move rather than why they move. He showed that experiment rather than logic is the best test of knowledge. Aristotle was an astute observer of nature, and he dealt with problems around him rather than with abstract cases that did not occur in his environment. Motion always involved a resistive medium such as air or water. He believed a vacuum to be impossible and therefore did not give serious consideration to motion in the absence of an interacting medium. That's why it was basic to Aristotle that an object requires a push or pull to keep it moving. And it was this basic principle that Galileo rejected when he stated that, if there is no interference with a moving object, it will keep moving in a straight line forever; no push, pull, or force of any kind is necessary.

Galileo tested this hypothesis by experimenting with the motion of various objects on plane surfaces tilted at various angles. He noted that balls rolling on downward-sloping planes picked up speed, while balls rolling on upward-sloping planes lost speed. From this he reasoned that balls rolling along a horizontal plane would neither speed up nor slow down. The ball would finally come to rest not because of its "nature," but because of friction. This idea was supported by Galileo's observation of motion along smoother surfaces: When there was less friction, the motion of objects persisted for a longer time; the less the friction, the more the motion approached constant speed. He reasoned that, in the absence of friction or other opposing forces, a horizontally moving object would continue moving indefinitely.

This assertion was supported by a different experiment and another line of reasoning. Galileo placed two of his inclined planes facing each other. He observed that a ball released from a position of rest at the top of a downward-sloping plane rolled down and then up the slope of the upward-sloping plane until it almost reached its initial height. He reasoned that only friction prevented it from rising to exactly the same height, for the smoother the planes, the closer the ball rose to the same height. Then he reduced the angle of the upward-sloping plane. Again the ball rose to the same height, but it had to go farther. Additional reductions of the angle yielded similar results; to reach the same height, the ball had to go farther each time. He then asked the question, "If I have a long horizontal plane, how far must the ball go to reach the same height?" The obvious answer is "Forever—it will never reach its initial height."

Galileo analyzed this in still another way. Because the downward motion of the ball from the first plane is the same for all cases, the speed of the ball when it begins moving up the second plane is the same for all cases. If it moves up a steep slope, it loses its speed rapidly. On a lesser slope, it loses its speed more slowly and rolls for a longer time. The less the upward slope, the more slowly it loses its speed. In the extreme case in which there is no slope at all—that is, when the plane is horizontal—the ball should not lose any speed. In the absence of retarding forces, the tendency of the ball is to move forever without slowing down. We call this property of an object to resist changes in motion inertia.

Galileo's concept of inertia discredited the Aristotelian theory of motion. Aristotle did not recognize the idea of inertia because he failed to imagine what motion would be like without friction. In his experience, all motion was subject to resistance, and he made this fact central to his theory of motion. Aristotle's failure to recognize friction for what it is—namely, a force like any other—impeded the progress of physics for nearly 2000 years, until the time of Galileo. An application of Galileo's concept of inertia would show that no force is required to keep Earth moving forward. The way was open for Isaac Newton to synthesize a new vision of the universe.

In 1642, several months after Galileo died, Isaac Newton was born. By the time Newton was 23, he developed his famous laws of motion, which completed the overthrow of the Aristotelian ideas that had dominated the thinking of the best minds for nearly two millennia. In this chapter, we will consider the first of Newton's laws. It is a restatement of the concept of inertia as proposed earlier by Galileo. (Newton's three laws of motion first appeared in one of the most important books of all time, Newton's Principia.)

Newton's First Law of Motion

Aristotle's idea that a moving object must be propelled by a steady force was completely turned around by Galileo, who stated that, in the absence of a force, a moving object will continue moving. The tendency of things to resist changes in motion was what Galileo called inertia. Newton refined Galileo's idea and made it his first law, appropriately called the law of inertia. From Newton's Principia (translated from the original Latin):

Every object continues in a state of rest or of uniform speed in a straight line unless acted on by a nonzero net force.

The key word in this law is continues: An object continues to do whatever it happens to be doing unless a force is exerted upon it. If it is at rest, it continues in a state of rest. This is nicely demonstrated when a tablecloth is skillfully whipped from under dishes on a tabletop, leaving the dishes in their initial state of rest. This property of objects to resist changes in motion is called inertia.

If an object is moving, it continues to move without turning or changing its speed. This is evident in space probes that continually move in outer space. Changes in motion must be imposed against the tendency of an object to retain its state of motion. In the absence of net forces, a moving object tends to move along a straight-line path indefinitely.

Net Force

Changes in motion are produced by a force or combination of forces (in the next chapter we'll refer to changes in motion as acceleration). A force, in the simplest sense, is a push or a pull. Its source may be gravitational, electrical, magnetic, or simply muscular effort. When more than a single force acts on an object, we consider the net force. For example, if you and a friend pull in the same direction with equal forces on an object, the forces combine to produce a net force twice as great as your single force. If each of you pull with equal forces in opposite directions, the net force is zero. The equal but oppositely directed forces cancel each other. One of the forces can be considered to be the negative of the other, and they add algebraically to zero, with a resulting net force of zero.

Figure 2.6 shows how forces combine to produce a net force. A pair of 5-newton forces in the same direction produce a net force of 10 newtons (the newton, N, is the scientific unit of force). If the 5-newton forces are in opposite directions, the net force is zero. If 10 newtons of force is exerted to the right and 5 newtons to the left, the net force is 5 newtons to the right. The forces are shown by arrows. A quantity such as force that has both magnitude and direction is called a vector quantity. Vector quantities can be represented by arrows whose length and direction show the magnitude and direction of the quantity. (More about vectors in Chapter 4.)

The Equilibrium Rule

If you tie a string around a 2-pound bag of flour and hang it on a weighing scale (Figure 2.7), a spring in the scale stretches until the scale reads 2 pounds. The stretched spring is under a "stretching force" called tension. The same scale in a science lab is likely calibrated to read the same force as 9 newtons. Both pounds and newtons are units of weight, which in turn are units of force. The bag of flour is attracted to Earth with a gravitational force of 2 pounds—or, equivalently, 9 newtons. Hang twice as much flour from the scale and the reading will be 18 newtons.

Note that there are two forces acting on the bag of flour—tension force acting upward and weight acting downward. The two forces on the bag are equal and opposite, and they cancel to zero. Hence, the bag remains at rest. In accord with Newton's first law, no net force acts on the bag. We can look at Newton's first law in a different light—mechanical equilibrium.

When the net force on something is zero, we say that something is in mechanical equilibrium. In mathematical notation, the equilibrium rule is (SIGMA)F = 0

The symbol (SIGMA) stands for "the vector sum of" and F stands for "forces." For a suspended object at rest, like the bag of flour, the rule says that the forces acting upward on the object must be balanced by other forces acting downward to make the vector sum equal zero. (Vector quantities take direction into account, so if upward forces are +, downward ones are —, and, when added, they actually subtract.) In Figure 2.8, we see the forces involved for Burl and Hewitt on their sign-painting scaffold. The sum of the upward tensions is equal to the sum of their weights plus the weight of the scaffold. Note how the magnitudes of the two upward vectors equal the magnitude of the three downward vectors. Net force on the scaffold is zero, so we say it is in mechanical equilibrium.

Support Force

Consider a book lying at rest on a table. It is in equilibrium. What forces act on the book? One force is that due to gravity—the weight of the book. Since the book is in equilibrium, there must be another force acting on the book to produce a net force of zero—an upward force opposite to the force of gravity. The table exerts this upward force. We call this the upward support force. This upward support force, often called the normal force, must equal the weight of the book. If we call the upward force positive, then the downward weight is negative, and the two add to become zero. The net force on the book is zero. Another way to say the same thing is (SIGMA)F = 0.

To understand better that the table pushes up on the book, compare the case of compressing a spring (Figure 2.9). If you push the spring down, you can feel the spring pushing up on your hand. Similarly, the book lying on the table compresses atoms in the table, which behave like microscopic springs. The weight of the book squeezes downward on the atoms, and they squeeze upward on the book. In this way, the compressed atoms produce the support force.

When you step on a bathroom scale, two forces act on the scale. One is your downward push on the scale—the result of gravity pulling on you—and the other is the upward support force of the floor. These forces squeeze a mechanism (in effect, a spring) within the scale that is calibrated to show the magnitude of the support force (Figure 2.10). It is this support force that shows your weight. When you weigh yourself on a bathroom scale at rest, the support force and the force of gravity pulling you down have the same magnitude. Hence we can say that your weight is the force of gravity acting on you.

Equilibrium of Moving Things

Rest is only one form of equilibrium. An object moving at constant speed in a straight-line path is also in equilibrium. Equilibrium is a state of no change. A bowling ball rolling at constant speed in a straight line is in equilibrium—until it hits the pins. Whether at rest (static equilibrium) or steadily rolling in a straight-line path (dynamic equilibrium), (SIGMA)F = 0.

It follows from Newton's first law that an object under the influence of only one force cannot be in equilibrium. Net force couldn't be zero. Only when two or more forces act on it can it be in equilibrium. We can test whether or not something is in equilibrium by noting whether or not it undergoes changes in its state of motion.

Consider a crate being pushed horizontally across a factory floor. If it moves at a steady speed in a straight-line path, it is in dynamic equilibrium. This tells us that more than one force acts on the crate. Another force exists—likely the force of friction between the crate and the floor. The fact that the net force on the crate equals zero means that the force of friction must be equal and opposite to our pushing force.

The equilibrium rule, (SIGMA)F = 0, provides a reasoned way to view all things at rest—balancing rocks, objects in your room, or the steel beams in bridges or in building construction. Whatever their configuration, if in static equilibrium, all acting forces always balance to zero. The same is true of objects that move steadily, not speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction. For dynamic equilibrium, all acting forces also balance to zero. The equilibrium rule is one that allows you to see more than meets the eye of the casual observer. It's nice to know the reasons for the stability of things in our everyday world.

There are different forms of equilibrium. In Chapter 8, we'll talk about rotational equilibrium, and, in Part 4, we'll discuss thermal equilibrium associated with heat. Physics is everywhere.

The Moving Earth

When Copernicus announced the idea of a moving Earth in the 16th century, the concept of inertia was not understood . There was much arguing and debate about whether or not Earth moved. The amount of force required to keep Earth moving was beyond imagination. Another argument against a moving Earth was the following: Consider a bird sitting at rest at the top of a tall tree. On the ground below is a fat, juicy worm. The bird sees the worm and drops vertically below and catches it. This would be impossible, it was argued, if Earth moved as Copernicus suggested. If Copernicus were correct, Earth would have to travel at a speed of 107,000 kilometers per hour to circle the Sun in one year. Convert this speed to kilometers per second and you'll get 30 kilometers per second. Even if the bird could descend from its branch in 1 second, the worm would have been swept by the moving Earth a distance of 30 kilometers away. It would be impossible for a bird to drop straight down and catch a worm. But birds in fact do catch worms from high tree branches, which seemed to be clear evidence that Earth must be at rest.

Can you refute this argument? You can if you invoke the idea of inertia. You see, not only is Earth moving at 30 kilometers per second but so are the tree, the branch of the tree, the bird that sits on it, the worm below, and even the air in between. All are moving at 30 kilometers per second. Things in motion remain in motion if no unbalanced forces are acting upon them. So, when the bird drops from the branch, its initial sideways motion of 30 kilometers per second remains unchanged. It catches the worm, quite unaffected by the motion of its total environment.

Stand next to a wall. Jump up so that your feet are no longer in contact with the floor. Does the 30-kilometer-per-second wall slam into you? It doesn't, because you are also traveling at 30 kilometers per second—before, during, and after your jump. The 30 kilometers per second is the speed of Earth relative to the Sun, not the speed of the wall relative to you.

People 400 years ago had difficulty with ideas like these, not only because they failed to acknowledge the concept of inertia but because they were not accustomed to moving in high-speed vehicles. Slow, bumpy rides in horsedrawn carriages did not lend themselves to experiments that would reveal the effect of inertia. Today we flip a coin in a high-speed car, bus, or plane, and we catch the vertically moving coin as we would if the vehicle were at rest. We see evidence for the law of inertia when the horizontal motion of the coin before, during, and after the catch is the same. The coin keeps up with us. The vertical force of gravity affects only the vertical motion of the coin.

Our notions of motion today are very different from those of our ancestors. Aristotle did not recognize the idea of inertia because he did not see that all moving things follow the same rules. He imagined that rules for motion in the heavens were very different from the rules of motion on Earth. He saw vertical motion as natural but horizontal motion as unnatural, requiring a sustained force. Galileo and Newton, on the other hand, saw that all moving things follow the same rules. To them, moving things require no force to keep moving if there are no opposing forces, such as friction. We can only wonder how differently science might have progressed if Aristotle had recognized the unity of all kinds of motion.
