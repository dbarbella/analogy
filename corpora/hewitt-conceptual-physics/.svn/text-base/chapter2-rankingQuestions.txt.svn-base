1. The weights of Burl, Paul, and the scaffold produce tensions in the supporting ropes. Rank the tension in the left rope, from most to least, in the three situations, A, B, and C.

2. Rank the net force on the block from least to most in the four situations, A, B, C, and D.

3. Different materials, A, B, C, and D, rest on a table.
3a. From greatest to least, rank them by how much they resist being set into motion.
3b. From greatest to least, rank them by the support (normal) force the table exerts on them.

4. Three pucks, A, B, and C, are shown sliding across ice at the noted speeds. Air and ice friction forces are negligible.
4a. Rank them, from greatest to least, by the force needed to keep them moving.
4b. Rank them, from greatest to least, by the force needed to stop them in the same time interval.
