Aristotle on Motion

1. Contrast Aristotle's ideas of natural motion and violent motion.

2. What class of motion, natural or violent, did Aristotle attribute to motion of the Moon?

3. What state of motion did Aristotle attribute to Earth?

Copernicus and the Moving Earth

4. What relationship between the Sun and Earth did Copernicus formulate?

Galileo and the Leaning Tower

5. What did Galileo discover in his legendary experiment on the Leaning Tower of Pisa?

Galileo's Inclined Planes

6. What did Galileo discover about moving bodies and force in his experiments with inclined planes?

7. What does it mean to say that a moving object has inertia? Give an example.

8. Is inertia the reason for moving objects maintaining motion or the name given to this property?

Newton's First Law of Motion

9. Cite Newton's first law of motion.
 
Net Force

10. What is the net force on a cart that is pulled to the right with 100 pounds and to the left with 30 pounds?

11. Why do we say that force is a vector quantity?

The Equilibrium Rule

12. Can force be expressed in units of pounds and also in units of newtons?

13. What is the net force on an object that is pulled with 80 newtons to the right and 80 newtons to the left?

14. What is the net force on a bag pulled down by gravity with 18 newtons and pulled upward by a rope with 18 newtons?

15. What does it mean to say something is in mechanical equilibrium?

16. State the equilibrium rule in symbolic notation.

Support Force

17. Consider a book that weighs 15 N at rest on a flat table. How many newtons of support force does the table provide? What is the net force on the book in this case?

18. When you stand at rest on a bathroom scale, how does your weight compare with the support force by the scale?

Equilibrium of Moving Things

19. A bowling ball at rest is in equilibrium. Is the ball in equilibrium when it moves at constant speed in a straight-line path?

20. What is the test for whether or not a moving object is in equilibrium?

21. If you push on a crate with a force of 100 N and it slides at constant velocity, how much is the friction acting on the crate?

The Moving Earth

22. What concept was missing in people's minds in the 16th century when they couldn't believe Earth was moving?

23. A bird sitting in a tree is traveling at 30 km/s relative to the faraway Sun. When the bird drops to the ground below, does it still go 30 km/s, or does this speed become zero?

24. Stand next to a wall that travels at 30 km/s relative to the Sun. With your feet on the ground, you also travel the same 30 km/s. Do you maintain this speed when your feet leave the ground? What concept supports your answer?

25. What did Aristotle fail to recognize about the rules of nature for objects on Earth and in the heavens?
