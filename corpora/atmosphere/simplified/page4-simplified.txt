If you live in a part of the world where it gets cold in the winter, you probably know how
nice it feels to snuggle under the thick layers of a padded quilt. but no matter where you
live, you are always surrounde by a sort of planetary quilt. It's the blanket of air called
the atmophere. Like any good quilt, the atmosphere covers and warms you. But rather than
safeguarding just one person, the atmosphere protects everything on our planet.
