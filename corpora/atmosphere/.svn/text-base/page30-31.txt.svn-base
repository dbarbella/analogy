Gases that trap heat in this way are called greenhouse gases, and their warming abiltiy is
known as the greenhouse effect. The names come from a garden building - a greenhouse - that is
made mostly of glass. In the same way that a glass greenhouse lets in sunlight and traps
warmth, atmospheric gases block heat but not light. The plants inside a greenhouse can grow
even if the weather is very cold outside. Likewise, living things on our planet thrive even
though conditions beyond our atmosphere cannot support life.
