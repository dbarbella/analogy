The chlorophyll molecule is a complex organization of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and
oxygen atoms surrounding a magnesium atom. Associated with these atoms is a cloud of
orbiting, negatively-charged electrons that are normally in a low-energy state. When a ray
of sunlight strikes the green plant, one of these low-energy electrons may absorb a
particle (called a photon or quantum) of light energy and jump to a higher energy level.

For a rough idea of the nature of this reaction, think of a test-your-strength circus
sideshow. He swings a heavy mallet, slams it down on the padded end of a lever, and sends
a weight shooting up a a grooved shaft woard a bell at the top. The weight strikes the bell,
making a loud clang.

The raised weight in this analogy represents the electron after it has aborbed a light
photon and moved to a higher energy level. Now imagine that in another instant the electron,
will crash down to ground level and dissipate its energy.
