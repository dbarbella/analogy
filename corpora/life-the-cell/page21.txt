Where does the energy come from that keeps a small boy going at full blast all day long?
For little boys, as for all living things, plant and animal, it comes from a tiny,
sausage-shaped pod with a Greek name, mitochondrion. The mitochondrion - along with
perhaps 1,000 more in every liver cell just like it - is the powerhouse of the cell.

Its job is like that of a generating plant in which a raw material - coal - is burned to
produce power - electricity - which is then sent out to light lamps, heat stoces, and
run machines. The mitochondrion's raw material is the food absorbed by the cell and
partly broken down in the cytoplasm. In a chemical operation, the cellular powerhouse
"burns" the food to release its energy and then loads this energy onto a chemical
molecule with a jawbreaker for a name: adenosine triphosphate, or ATP for short. This
precious stuff - essentially raw power - is to cells what electricity is to machines in
a factory: it runs them.
