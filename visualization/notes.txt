# What I was able to do
Make a graph which details the results of the classification with
different classifiers



# What I attempted to do but was not successful
- Find a way to retrieve the output of what tfidf, count, and hashing 
produce, which we can build some visualization on.
- Rearrange the specifications to get the desired diagram.
