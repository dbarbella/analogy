Download Stanford parser at : https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml and place it in a same folder as the parser.py file.
In the stanford-parser folder, create a folder named "jars" and place two files inside it:
- stanford-english-corenlp-2018-02-27-models.jar. The file can be found at: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/download.html
- stanford parser.jar

In the folder 2018. Run the file: parser.py. This file has not yet been commented on. The file for now will print out the sentence, the base, and the target and the running time. 
The sample data is taken from sampleTraining.csv. There are only some samples as I am developing the algorithm.
