frameSimilarityDetector:
    The frame similarity detector exists as a tool to find and return connections 
    between frames. These connections can be direct and given as super or 
    subframes, but can also take the form of "similar" frames. Similar frames are 
    frames that have a large number of subelements or sub/superframes in common.
    
    The frame similarity detector also contains a frame object definition and a 
    parser to help extract information from input frame text/xml files.
    
    The data returned by the frame similarity detector is intended to help
    establish a sentence's context. This context can be established as an idea,
    and this idea can be generated by using the frame similarity detector in 
    conjunction with a word connotation quantifier and generator that returns 
    an idea. This resulting idea can be used in a variety of cases ranging from
    analogy detection to sentence meaning extraction.
    
    Frame Functions:
        addElements(elements)
            elements = a list of frame elements to add to the frame
            adds elements to a frame
        addElement(element)
            element = one element to add to the frame
            adds one element to a frame
        addRelations(relations)
            relations = a list of frame relations to add to the frame
            adds relations to a frame
        addRelation(relation)
            relation = one relation to add to the frame
            adds one relation to a frame
        setName(name)
            name = a string name of the frame
            sets the name of a frame
        getElements()
            returns the elements of a frame
        getRelations()
            returns concretely related frames to a frame
        similarTo(other, threshold=0<=Threshold<=100)
            returns abstractly related frames to a frame. % Difference below a 
            threshold. Default = .75. .1  =>  ~ 34 frames similar
                                      .4  => ~ 74 frames similar
                                      .5  => ~77 frames similar
                                      .6  => ~ 125 frames similar
                                      .75 => ~ 338 frames similar
                                      .8  => ~ 512 similar frames
                            
            (Symmetric)
            (Returns frames with a large number of common elements / frame
             relations)
            
    Frame Parser Fucntions:
        __init__(file)
            constructs a frame parser with a given text file
        has_next()
            returns whether or not the initial frame file has lines left to read
        proceed()
            proceeds to the next line if there is a next line. Otherwise raises
            an assertion error
        i_type()
            returns the type of the frame item currently being read from the file
            can return: 'C_Fr_Relation', 'C_FE_Relation',"C_Other"
        getSubId()
            returns the id of the subelement currently being evaluated
        getSupId()
            returns the id of the superelement currently being evaluated
        getSuperName()
            returns the name of the superelement currently being evaluated
        getSubName()
            returns the name of the subelement currently being evaluated
        getId()
            returns the id of the current file line being evaluated
        
    Functions:
        loadFrames(fileName)
            fileName: a string of the name of the file
        getRelation(start, frames, depth, curDepth=0)
            returns a list of frames from an input frame storage file
                    Returns a list of frames related to the given start frame, indirectly
            out to a depth
            
            start = a frame from which to generate relations
            frames = the list of frames to find relations in
            depth = the number of direct relations to follow out
            
        getSimilarityAtDepth(start, frames, depth, curDepth=0)
            '''
            getSimilarityAtDepth:        
                Returns a set of frames related or "similar" to the starting frame.
                Frame similarity is defined by frame's internal similarity function
                (if compared frames have a large number of similar frame elements
                and relations)
            
            start = a frame from which to generate relations
            frames = the list of frames to find relations in
            depth = the number of direct relations to follow out
