The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took place .
>
The jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted .
>
The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr. .
>
`` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city '' .
>
The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' .
>
It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' .
>
The grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' .
>
Merger proposed However , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration '' .

Implementation of Georgia's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury .

It urged that the next Legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected '' .

The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes .
>
`` This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program '' , the jury said , but the State Welfare Department `` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County , which receives none of this money .
>
The jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties '' .
>
Nevertheless , `` we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds '' , the jurors said . `` Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden '' on Fulton taxpayers .

The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation .

Wards protected The jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations '' of two previous grand juries , the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee .

`` These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms '' , the jury said .
>
Regarding Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences '' .
>
The jury did not elaborate , but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable '' .
>
Ask jail deputies On other matters , the jury recommended that : ( 1 ) Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and `` a doctor , medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail '' . ( 2 ) Fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable '' pension plan for city employes .

Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race , a top official said Wednesday .
>
Robert Snodgrass , state GOP chairman , said a meeting held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience .
>
State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen. John Tower will be the featured speaker .
>
In the Blue Ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters .
>
Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according to Republicans who attended .
>
When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no -- and there were no dissents .
>
The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : 1 Five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot , or 2 The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system -- a system which the party opposes in its platform .

Schley County Rep. B. D. Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances .

Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie '' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought .

While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out , Pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31 .

The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state .

There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House .
>
It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here .
>
Operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of Dallas , Harris , Bexar , Tarrant and El Paso would be $451,500 , which would be a savings of $157,460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed , Parkhouse told the Senate .

The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County , saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school .

When the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas .

Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen. Parkhouse . The bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project .

Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten's attack .

The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite Mr. Rusk's personal popularity , that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots .

Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program , Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director .

He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs .

Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job . One of these men is former Fire Chief John A. Laughlin , he said .

One advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program .

Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , sirens and rescue trucks , he said .

Mr. Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the CD vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station .

He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford area .

Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city , Mr. Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack .

The Narragansett Race Track grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a drive-in theater in Seekonk would be another . Riverside residents would go to the Seekonk assembly point .

Such vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know .

If the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time CD director , Mr. Hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally .

William A. Martinelli , chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston , transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond Fortin Sr. .

Even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time , no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political future .
>
This is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants -- Gov. Ross Barnett .
>
Barnett , who came into office with no previous experience in public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well .
>
Consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming year .
>
Could be scramble Some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far .
>
Could be scramble Some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far .
>
The builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's office .
>
There are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a scramble .
>
Certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful `` honeymoon '' he had in the 1960 legislative session .
>
If Barnett doesn't call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session .
>
The odds favor a special session , more than likely early in the year .
>
Districts issue Legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $22.50 per diem is not certain ) and if they start agitating . Barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure .

The issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat .

With eyes focused on the third congressional district , the historic Delta district , and Congressman Frank E. Smith as the one most likely to go , the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature .

Mississippi's relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White House .

Split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents , the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a wreck . And there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together .

With a Democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election .

Now , the picture is clouded , and even US Sens. James O. Eastland and John C. Stennis , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their status .

Reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen . Baton Rouge , La. -- The Gov. Jimmie H. Davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses .

The year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue . But it might give way shortly to another vexing issue -- that of finances in state government .
>
The transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent .
>
The administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program .
>
But the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation .
>
Legislators weary Indeed , the administration's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat . The administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program .

The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote .

The tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature reconvenes .

Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to normalcy .

If it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration . He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature .

Then he could tell them to go home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period .

It is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one .
>
But if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes .

This would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash . It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year .

If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma .
>
Since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues .
>
Constant problem In either case , it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser .

The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor . It is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem .
>
But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off , it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature .
>
This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature , so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year .
>
A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize .
>
Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves .
>
The new year might see some house-cleaning , either genuine or token , depending upon developments , to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms .

City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had `` an inside track '' with the city .

Estimates of the city's loss in the $344,000 job have ranged as high as $200,000 .

Shortcuts unnoticed Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the `` legitimate '' bids of competing contractors .

Samuel D. Goodis , representing the Philadelphia Hotel Association , objected on Tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees , saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year .

Goodis voiced his objection before City Council's Finance Committee .

For hotels with 1000 rooms , the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000 a year , Goodis said .
